- Reproducibility is a foundational aspect to scientific research. 

- Data visualizations tell you a story, where statistical tests only tell you a summary.  

- Multiple regression and two-way ANOVA are powerful tools to explore multivariate relationships. 

- A well thought out study is more powerful than any statistical analysis.
