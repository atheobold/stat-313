## Study Design and ANOVA 

</br> 

Why would a study employ blocking?  

</br> 

If the blocking variable was included in an ANOVA, would you expect for it to be "statistically significant"? 

## Blocking and Two-Way ANOVA 

Suppose the study yields the following ANOVA table. 


| term            | statistic     | p-value|
| --------------- |:-------------:| ------:|
| treatment       | 4.25          | 0.035  |
| block           | 3.5           | 0.015  |
| treatment:block | 2.5           | 0.01   |

</br> 

Are there issues if there is evidence of an interaction between the blocking variable and the treatment?
