# Introduction

<!-- Take your original Introduction from the Midterm Project and spice it up!
<!-- At a bare minimum your revised Introduction should include:
<!--   * a persuasive argument as to *why* this investigation is worthwhile
<!--   * substantial background of the data context, the unit of study, number
of observations)  -->

<!-- Clearly outline the question(s) of interest you will address with the 
statistical analysis.  -->



# Statistical Methods 

<!-- Provide a summary table of the mean, standard deviation, and sample -->
<!-- size for the course evaluation scores of each attractiveness group.  -->

<!-- Produce a data visualization exploring the relationship between  -->
<!-- course evaluation score and attractiveness group.  -->

<!-- Produce another visualization that incorporates your chosen -->
<!-- categorical variable into your previous visualization.  -->

<!-- Describe what you see in the visualizations, making direct references to
the plots!  -->

<!-- For each of your research questions, outline what statistical model -->
<!-- you will use to address the question.  -->
  
<!-- Check all model conditions for the statistical methods you used.  -->



# Summary of Statistical Findings

<!-- What is your conclusion for the first research question? Namely, "Does the
mean course evaluation score differ for at least one attractiveness group?"  -->

<!-- Interpret **in the context of the data** the p-value associated with 
attr_cat in your ANOVA table.  -->

<!-- What is your conclusion for the second research question? Namely, "Does the
relationship between course evaluation scores and attractiveness differ based on
___?".   -->

<!-- Interpret __in the context of the data__ the p-value associated with the interaction term in your ANOVA table.  -->

  
# Scope of Inference

<!-- At a bare minimum, your revisions should incorporate: -->
<!-- - the feedback I provided
<!-- - a description of the population of interest
<!-- - a description of the sample selected
<!-- - a justification as to who the results of the study can be inferred to
<!-- - a description of the relationships found in the analysis
<!-- - a justification as to whether causal statements can be made
<!-- - a conclusion about what type of relationships can be inferred


# Study Limitations 

<!-- What limitations do you see from how attractiveness was scored for each
professor?  -->

<!-- What limitations do you see from how gender was included in this 
study?  -->

<!-- What limitations do you see from how ethnicity was included in this 
study?  -->
