This week you will get started on your midterm project by 
selecting what dataset you wish to analyze and writing an
introduction about the dataset you chose.

# Step 1: Picking a Dataset

## Option 1 -- Use your own data

If you have a dataset from another course or your own research which you
believe can be appropriately modeled with a *linear regression*, you can
propose to use these data. 

### Deliverable

For the **Midterm Project Proposal** assignment on Canvas, you are required to state *at the beginning* of the document, that you have chosen to use your own dataset. You are also required to submit your dataset as either an Excel file (.csv or .xlsx).

## Option 2 -- Use a public dataset

I've compiled a list of datasets from a variety of contexts, 
all which are relatively tidy and ready for analysis.

From the **lterdatasampler** package:

- [`and_vertebrates`](https://lter.github.io/lterdatasampler/articles/and_vertebrates_vignette.html): Size data for Cutthroat trout and salamanders in different sections of forest (from Lab 3). 
- [`ntl_icecover`](https://lter.github.io/lterdatasampler/articles/ntl_icecover_vignette.html): Data on duration of ice cover of lakes in the Madison, WI area (from Lab 4). 
- [`hbr_maples`](https://lter.github.io/lterdatasampler/articles/hbr_maples_vignette.html): Data on the growth of Sugar Maple (Acer saccharum) seedlings in response to calcium addition. 
- [`pie_crab`](https://lter.github.io/lterdatasampler/articles/pie_crab_vignette.html): Data on Fiddler crab body size in salt marshes from Florida to Massachusetts.

From the **openintro** package:

- [`ncbirths`](https://www.openintro.org/data/index.php?data=ncbirths): Data from North Carolina births in 2004 (from Week 4).
- [`possum`](https://www.openintro.org/data/index.php?data=possum): Data representing possums in Australia and New Guinea.

From the **moderndive** package:

- [`evals`](https://moderndive.github.io/moderndive/reference/evals.html): Data from end of semester student evaluations from
University of Texas at Austin (discussed in ModernDive textbook).

From the **gapminder** package:

- [`gapminder`](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/gapminder/readme/README.html): Data on life expectancy, GDP per capita, and population by country (discussed in ModernDive textbook).

### Deliverable

For the **Midterm Project Proposal** assignment on Canvas, you are required to state *at the beginning* of the document, the name of the dataset you have chosen to use. 

# Step 2: Writing an Introduction

## If you chose to use your own data

**Step 1:** Describe the context of your dataset in your own words! How were the data collected? Was there a study these data came from? 

I don't know **anything** about your data, so I expect for this description to be *extensive*. If the data you are using are from a class, you are responsible for obtaining the context of the data--you cannot simply say "These were data used in BIO 253."

**Step 2:** Choose your variables

Describe **at least three** variables you are interested in. Choose one variable for the response and at least two explanatory variables. 

## If you chose a dataset from the list above

**Step 1:** Describe the context of your dataset in your own words! How were the data collected? Was there a study these data came from?

**Step 2:** Choose your variables

Describe **at least three** variables you are interested in. Choose one variable for the response and at least two explanatory variables. 

# Step 3: Submitting on Canvas

For the **Midterm Project Proposal** assignment on Canvas, your proposal is required to consist of **both** components (dataset and description).

You are allowed to use any text editing software to make your critique (e.g., Word, Pages, Google Docs), but your submission **must be a PDF**. If you are unsure how to save your file as a PDF, I recommend using Google!

Remember, if you chose to use your own dataset, you are required to submit your data as an Excel file (.csv or .xlsx).
