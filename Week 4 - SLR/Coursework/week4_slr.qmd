Welcome!

In this week's coursework we are going to start exploring statistical
methods---linear regression. We will start with the "basic" case or simple
linear regression, with a single quantitative explanatory variable and a
quantitative response. We will review the concepts behind linear regression,
learn how to visualize regression models, and practice obtaining the estimated
regression lines in `R`. 


<!-- TODO: use images from here https://allisonhorst.com/linear-regression-dragons -->

## Learning Outcomes 

By the end of this coursework you should be able to:

- describe the difference between explanatory and predictive modeling 
- produce data visualizations for a simple linear regression
- describe how `R` decides on the "best" regression line
- fit a simple linear regression in `R`
- write out an estimated regression line
- interpret the slope of an estimated regression line
- interpret the intercept of an estimated regression line
- describe what an "offset" is in a simple linear regression
- interpret the offsets of an estimated regression line
- calculate a residual for an observation

Don't worry about Section 5.3.3, it goes a bit too in the weeds for what we are

# `r emo::ji("check")` Concept Quiz: Basic Linear Regression -- Due Tuesday by noon

**1. What does the correlation coefficient measure?**

- strength of a relationship between two variables
- strength of a linear relationship between two variables
- strength of a relationship between two numerical variables 
- strength of a linear relationship between two numerical variables

**2. How do you interpret a slope coefficient?**

- For any increase of $x$, the slope is the expected increase in $y$
- For any increase of $x$, the slope is the expected increase in the mean of
$y$
- For a 1-unit increase in $x$, the slope is the expected increase in $y$
- For a 1-unit increase in $x$, the slope is the expected increase in the mean
of $y$

**3. How do you interpret an intercept coefficient?**

- For a 1-unit increase in $x$, the intercept is the expected increase in $y$
- For a 1-unit increase in $x$, the intercept is the expected increase in the
mean of $y$
- For an $x$ value of 0, the intercept is the expected value of $y$
- For an $x$ value of 0, the intercept is the expected value of the mean of $y$ 

**4. Match the _explanatory_ and _response_ variables to the correct variables
in the `lm()` function syntax.** 

`lm(variable1 ~ variable2, data = <NAME OF DATASET>)`

**5. What `geom_` adds a linear regression line to a scatterplot?**

- `geom_line()`
- `geom_smoother()`
- `geom_regression()`
- `geom_smooth()`
