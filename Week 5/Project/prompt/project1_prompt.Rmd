# Write-Up Guidelines

You will be summarizing your results in a (guided) written report following the
__Project Writing Guidelines__ posted on Canvas. The results __must__ be 
written in the RMarkdown template provided. You can include all pertinent plots
inline in the typed document, rather than in the appendix. Your group will be 
submitting both the RMarkdown file used to generate your report and the knitted 
HTML file to Canvas by __Sunday, february 7 at 11:59pm__. 

Begin by downloading the RMarkdown and data files from Canvas and saving them on
your computer in the __same__ folder. Then open the RMarkdown file in RStudio 
and run the first code chunks loading packages and reading the data in. If you
encounter an error, make sure that the data are located in the **same** folder
as the RMarkdown file! 

# Data Background 

Today, most colleges and universities require a standardized test for applicants,
such as the SAT or the ACT. Due to this requirement, roughly 2 million students
in the U.S. take the SAT each year. Disappointingly, the 
[Varsity Blues scandal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2019_college_admissions_bribery_scandal) 
has left a large number of people questioning the role that wealth 
plays in student's standardized test scores. 

A 2013 study by Dixon-Roman and Mcardle titled ["Race, Poverty, and SAT Scores"](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/280232788_Race_Poverty_and_SAT_Scores_Modeling_the_Influences_of_Family_Income_on_Black_and_White_High_School_Students'_SAT_Performance)
found that "the effects of family income on SAT scores, though relatively modest
in contrasts to high school achievement, are substantial. These researchers
investigated the relationship between high school achievement 
and SAT scores, controlling for mother's and father's education and family 
income. Specifically, this study considered SAT data from 2003. 

In this project we will investigate the relationship between the average SAT 
math score and average SAT verbal score. We will then explore if this
relationship differs for different family incomes. We will use data for each
state in the United States from 2005 to 2015, but **will not** use state or year 
as explanatory variables in our model. 

As is typical in educational data, students are not randomly assigned to a
"treatment" group, rather the characteristics of thes students are observed. 
Additionally, as these are data from **every** student who took the SAT exam in 
each state from 2005 to 2015, we have a *census* of the population.

# Introduction (5 pts)

- (2 pts) Give a brief background of the research problem and how the data were
collected. Make sure to describe who the unit of study is (e.g. students? states? 
years?)! 

- (3 pts) Clearly outline the question(s) of interest you will address with the
statistical analysis. The more specific you define the question of interest
here, the easier the rest of the analysis and report will be. The research
questions should start with, "What is the relationship between..." and should be
as specific as possible. Your _Summary of Statistical Findings_ should directly
answer the question(s) you pose here.


# Statistical Methods (15 pts)

This section should lay out the steps, decisions, and logic leading to the
statistical model you will use to answer the research question of interest.

- (2 pts) Describe the response and explanatory variables.

- (2 pts) Provide a summary table of the median average SAT math and SAT verbal 
scores for every year in the data

**Note:** Keep in mind that the `Math` and `Verbal` variables represent the 
*average* SAT math and SAT verbal scores. 

- (3 pts) Produce data visualizations exploring the relationship(s) you are 
interested in investigating. Describe what you see in the visualizations, making
direct references to the plots! 

**Note:** Keep in mind that there are a large number of observations in the
dataset, so you may want to use tools that help to alleviate overplotting! 

- (4 pts) Describe the appropriate statistical model you will use to answer
the question(s) of interest that you stated previously. Be specific about why the 
method being used are appropriate for the investigation at hand (e.g. types of 
variables). 

- (4 pts) Check all model conditions of the statistical method you used. 
Describe what each condition is __in the context of these data__. Reference and
include appropriate plots necessary for checking the model conditions in line. 
What are your conclusions regarding the conditions? Justify your conclusions! 

# Summary of Statistical Findings (10 pts)

In this section you will write up your findings for each research question of
interest.

- (5 pts) What is your conclusion for the questions of interest? Namely, 
"What is the relationship between the SAT verbal and SAT math scores?" and "How
does the relationship differ by family income?". Base your conclusion on the
visualizations you created **and** the regression model you found. 

- (5 pts) Interpret __in the context of the data__ each of the coefficient
estimates you got from R.

# Scope of Inference (4 pts)

Write a brief Scope of Inference statement. Specifically, answer these two
questions and comment on their implications:

- (2 pts) Were the observations randomly selected from some larger population?
Based on the sampling method used, what larger population can you infer the
results to? 

- (2 pts) Was the explanatory variable randomly assigned to observations? Based
on the study design, are cause-and-effect statements justified?

Make sure you write the scope of inference specific to the language of the
data (not just generic statements)!

# Project Presentation (3 pts) 

- (1 pts) Your report should not have any spelling errors! To check for spelling 
errors in RStudio, click the green check mark button next to the "Knit" button. 

- (2 pts) Your report should look as neat and professional as possible. Make 
sure that your figures don't end up in the middle of your paragraphs, and that 
your sections have headings. If you would like to fine tune the appearance of
your report, please post questions to Canvas and I will respond ASAP. 

**Note on Figures:** I expect that the figures are included in the section they 
are discussed not at the end of the report. 

**Note on Model Output:** Please try to make the output from the statistical
model look as nice as possible. Output from `summary()` looks terrible in a
statistical report! Try using the `get_regression_table()` function from the
**moderndive** package or the `tidy()` function from the **broom** package. 

# Group Evaluation (3 pts)

Each member of your group will fill out a group evaluation form detailing each 
member's contributions, cooperation, communication, and participation.
