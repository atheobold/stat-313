## Grouped Summaries 

Another useful technique is quickly calculating summary statistics for various
groups in your data frame. For example, we can modify the above command using
the `group_by()` function to get the same summary stats for each origin airport:

```{r}
sfo_feb_flights %>%
  group_by(origin) %>%
  summarise(median_dd = median(dep_delay), 
            iqr_dd = IQR(dep_delay), 
            n_flights = n())
```

Here, we first grouped the data by `origin` and __then__ calculated the summary
statistics.


**Question 6** -- Find the average departure delays for each month. 
**Bonus:** Arrange these average delays in ascending order. 
**Hint:** The `arrange()` function is helpful for arranging numbers!

```{r}
