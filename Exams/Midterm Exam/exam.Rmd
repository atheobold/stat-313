## LINEAR MODELS

## Question 1 

<center>

A linear regression is one type of model in the broad class of "linear models." 
What are the characteristics of these linear models? What are the requirements 
for using these types of statistical models? 

## Question 2

<center>

Describe to someone who has never taken a statistics course the difference 
between simple linear regression and multiple linear regression. 

## Question 3

<center> 

What are the strengths and weaknesses of linear regression?  

## Question 4 

<center> 

Some textbooks state that regression should not be used if there are
"outliers" in the data. Why is this an important condition to consider? What are
the implications of removing every "outlier" from a dataset?  

## Question 5 

<center> 

Most people are familiar with the saying that "correlation does not imply 
causation." However, when some researchers find a strong correlation between 
their explanatory and response variables (r > 0.8), they often interpret the 
relationship as "larger values in x **_lead to_** larger values in y." What is an 
issue with this interpretation? In this scenario, what could researchers 
conclude?  


## Additional Topics - Question Bank

## Question 1 

<center> 

Describe to someone who has never taken a Statistics course what the principle 
of parsimony (or Occam's razor) is. 

## Question 2 

<center> 

Much of what we have done thus far using `R` and R Markdown documents could
have been done using Excel and Word. What are the benefits of using `R` and 
R Markdown documents? What are the costs?  

## Question 3 

<center> 

We have spent a great deal of time producing and critiquing data
visualizations, and have yet to discuss statistical testing (e.g. 
hypothesis tests and p-values). What information can a data visualization
provide you that a data summary or a statistical test cannot?   

## Question 4 

<center> 

Random samples and experiments are often thought of as the "gold standard" of 
study design. Why are these aspects of a study so highly valued? What
difficulties may researchers encounter when attempting to utilize these 
designs in their study? 

## Question 5 

<center> 

How is statistics used in the generation of scientific knowledge? How is
dichotomous thinking used in statistics? How is objectivity related to each of 
these areas?
