# Statistical Inference - Question Bank 

You will be asked one randomly selected question from this bank of questions
during your oral exam. 

\vspace{0.25cm}

1. Explain to someone who has never taken a statistics course what a p-value is. 

\vspace{0.25cm}

2. Explain to someone who has never taken a statistics course what a confidence
interval is. 

\vspace{0.25cm}

3. It is very likely researchers in your field are familiar with parametric
tests (e.g. $t$-test, $F$-test) but are not familiar with simulation based
methods (e.g. permutation test, bootstrap confidence interval). Explain to
someone in your field the similarities and differences between these two
methods. 

\vspace{0.25cm}

4. Large portions of the scientific community are pushing to eliminate p-value
thresholds for publication of scientific research. What is the role of a p-value
threshold (e.g. 0.05) in hypothesis testing? What are the benefits and costs of
eliminating p-value thresholds? 

\vspace{0.25cm}

5. What is a sampling distribution? How are randomization and bootstrap
distributions used to approximate a sampling distribution?

# Linear Models - Question Bank

You will be asked one randomly selected question from this bank of questions
during your oral exam. 

\vspace{0.25cm}

1. Suppose a researcher performs a one-way ANOVA and finds strong evidence to
reject the null. They are interested in reporting which groups are
"significantly" different from each other and are planning to perform tests for
a difference in means for all of the groups that visually appear to be different.
Explain to this individual the issues with this analysis strategy and propose an
alternative strategy they should take. 

\vspace{0.25cm}

2. When the conditions for a linear regression are violated, how are the
associated p-value and confidence interval impacted? How do these impacts differ
for simulation based methods versus parametric methods? 

\vspace{0.25cm}

3. A one-way ANOVA compares the means of three or more groups, and summarizes
these differences with an F-statistic. What are the components of an F-statistic
and what does each term symbolize in terms of the variability of the responses? 

\vspace{0.25cm}

4. What are the similarities and differences between a two-way ANOVA model and a
multiple linear regression? What does it mean to have "parallel lines" in a
two-way ANOVA? What does it mean to have "different slopes" in a two-way ANOVA?  

\vspace{0.25cm}

5. Suppose an experiment is designed to use blocking to account for a possible
confounding variable. The analysis of the experiment's results yields the
following ANOVA table: 

| term            | statistic     | p-value|
| --------------- |:-------------:| ------:|
| treatment       | 4.25          | 0.035  |
| block           | 3.5           | 0.015  |
| treatment:block | 2.5           | 0.00   |

Are there issues if there is evidence of an interaction between the blocking
variable and the treatment? Why or why not?
