Week One Announcement

Since this is the first week of our course, I wanted to send out a schedule of
what you can expect this week. In a typical week you will have one "coursework"
page you will walk through in Canvas, but this week you have two! The first 
coursework page walks you through the course set-up. The second walks you
through the statistical content for this week. 

In the set-up, you will need to:

- read the syllabus
- take the syllabus quiz
- join the course Discord

In the statistical content, you will: 

- complete a survey for me to get to know you
- complete a survey for group construction
- read Chapter One in the Introduction to Modern Statistics textbook
- find a peer-reviewed publication in your field that uses statistics 
- think through the group discussion questions for the week
