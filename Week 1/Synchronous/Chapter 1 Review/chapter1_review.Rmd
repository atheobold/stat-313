## Welcome to Our Course

__Group Norms:__

- Zero tolerance for: racism, sexism, homophobia, transphobia, ageism, ableism 
- Do not make generalizations -- Use "I" statements

- Respect one another

- Take space, make space -- Share the air (page) 
<!-- Challenge yourself to take space if you tend to be quieter, make space if you -->
<!-- find yourself talking a lot or otherwise taking up space. -->
<!-- Be aware of your airtime to ensure all voices are heard. -->

- Embrace discomfort

## What is Statistics?

> Scientists seek to answer questions using rigorous methods and careful
> observations. These observations – collected from the likes of field notes,
> surveys, and experiments – form the backbone of a statistical investigation
> and are called data.  

> Statistics is the study of how best to collect, analyze,
> and draw conclusions from data.

## What Statistics Is To Me

## Data

<center>
Gender stereotypes in 5-7 year old children
</center>

</br>
        
```{r, echo = FALSE}
children_gender_stereo[[2]] %>% 
  rename(sex = gender) %>% 
  sample_n(6) %>%
  kable(format = "html") %>% 
  kable_styling(bootstrap_options = c("striped", "condensed"), 
                latex_options = "striped")
  
```

## In Every Context 

<center> 
NBA player of the week from 1985 to 2016
</center>

</br>

```{r, echo = FALSE}
nba %>% 
  sample_n(6) %>%
  select(Age:Position) %>% 
  kable(format = "html") %>% 
    kable_styling(bootstrap_options = c("striped", "condensed"), 
                latex_options = "striped")
```

## You Could Imagine

<center>
Fish Sampled on Blackfoot River
</center>

</br>

```{r, echo = FALSE}
fish %>% 
  sample_n(6) %>%
  kable(format = "html") %>% 
    kable_styling(bootstrap_options = c("striped", "condensed"), 
                latex_options = "striped")
```

## Types of Variables

![](variables.png)

## 90 Second Writing Exercise

Data were collected on thousands of loans made through the Lending Club platform, a platform that allows individuals to lend to other individuals. 

A total of 55 variables were collected on every loan that was made, including information about: 

- the borrower's employment, credit, current financial status, tax filings
- the loan's details, date of issue, balance, and current status

</br> 
<center>
__What do you expect this dataframe would look like?__ 
</center>

## Data Types in `R`

```{r echo = TRUE}
glimpse(loans_full_schema)
```


## Sampling Strategies 

<div class="columns-2">

```{r pop-to-sample, fig.width = 4.5, fig.height = 5}
par_og <- par(no.readonly = TRUE) # save original par
par(mar = rep(0, 4))
plot(c(0, 2),
     c(0, 1.1),
     type = 'n',
     axes = FALSE, 
     xlab = "",
     ylab = "")
temp <- seq(0, 2 * pi, 2 * pi / 100)
x <- 0.5 + 0.5 * cos(temp)
y <- 0.5 + 0.5 * sin(temp)
lines(x, y)

s <- matrix(runif(700), ncol = 2)
S <- matrix(NA, 350, 2)
j <- 0
for (i in 1:nrow(s)) {
  if(sum((s[i, ] - 0.5)^2) < 0.23){
    j <- j + 1
    S[j, ] <- s[i, ]
  }
}
points(S, col = COL[1, 3], pch = 20)
text(0.5, 1, 'population', pos = 3, cex = 1.3)

set.seed(50)
N <- sample(j, 25)
lines((x - 0.5) / 2 + 1.5, (y - 0.5) / 2 +  0.5, pch = 20)

SS <- (S[N, ] - 0.5) / 2 + 0.5
these <- c(2, 5, 11, 10, 12)
points(SS[these, 1] + 1,
       SS[these, 2],
       col = COL[4, 2],
       pch = 20,
       cex = 1.5)
text(1.5, 0.75, 'sample', pos = 3, cex = 1.3)

for (i in these) {
  arrows(S[N[i], 1], S[N[i], 2],
         SS[i, 1] + 1 - 0.03, SS[i, 2],
         length = 0.08, col = COL[5], lwd = 1.5)
}
par(par_og) # restore original par
```

- Simple random sample

- Stratified random sample

- Cluster sample

- Multistage sample

</div>

## Types of Studies

**Experiment** 

- randomization 
- replication 
- controlling
- blocking

</br>

**Observational Study** 

- collect data in a way that does not directly interfere with how the data arise

## Relationships Between Variables

<center>
explanatory variable $\rightarrow$ *might affect* $\rightarrow$ response variable
</center>

</br>

- If two variables are not associated, then they are said to be __independent__. 

- If two variables are associated, then they are said to be __dependent__. 

<!-- - No pair of variables is both associated and independent!  -->

</br>

<center>
association $\neq$ causation 
</center>

</br>

__What do you need to say that the explanatory variable **causes** a change in
the response variable?__ 

## Group Exercise

The following scatterplot was created as part of a study evaluating the
relationship between estimated life expectancy at birth (as of 2014) and
percentage of internet users (as of 2009) in 208 countries for which such data
were available.

```{r, fig.width = 5, fig.height= 3, fig.align = "center"}
library(scales)

cia_factbook %>% 
ggplot(aes(y = life_exp_at_birth,
           x = internet_users/population)) +
  geom_point(color = COL["blue", "full"], alpha = 0.8) +
  scale_x_continuous(
    labels = label_percent(scale = 100),
    limits = c(0, 1)) +
  labs(
    x = "Percent internet users",
    y = "Life expectancy",
    title = "Life Expectancy vs. Percent Internet Users", 
    subtitle = "Data from 2014 from the CIA Factbook"
    ) +
  theme_minimal()
    ```

## Questions for Me

- Content questions? 

- Course structure questions?  

- Programming in `R` questions?
