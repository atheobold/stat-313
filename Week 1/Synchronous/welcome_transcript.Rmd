> Scientists seek to answer questions using rigorous methods and careful
> observations. These observations – collected from the likes of field notes,
> surveys, and experiments – form the backbone of a statistical investigation
> and are called data.  

> Statistics is the study of how best to collect, analyze,
> and draw conclusions from data.
