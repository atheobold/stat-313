Week One Announcement

Since this is the first week of our course, I wanted to send out a schedule of
what you can expect this week. This week's expectations fall into two groups,
(1) surveys and sign-ups, and (2) reading, quiz, and discussion.

For group one, you are expected to:

- complete the Stat 313 course survey (link)
- sign-up for two times during the quarter to participate in (synchronous) small
group collaborations

For group two, you are expected to:

- read Chapter One in the OpenIntro textbook
- post your response to the Week One Concept discussion (link), and create
meaningful responses to two of the members of your group
- complete the Introduction to R and RStudio tutorial
- input your responses to the Introduction to R and RStudio tutorial questions
in the Introduction to R and RStudio quiz on Canvas (link)

If you have questions about accessing material or instructions, please post your
questions in the General Course Questions discussion forum.
