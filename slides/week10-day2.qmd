I hope you leave this class understanding...
:::

-   Reproducibility is a foundational aspect to scientific research.

-   Data visualizations tell you a story, where statistical tests only tell you a summary.

-   Multiple regression and ANOVA are powerful tools to explore multivariate relationships.

-   A well thought out study is more powerful than any statistical analysis.

**Eugenics & Statistics**

> *Ideally, statisticians would like to divorce these tools from the lives and times of the people who created them. It would be convenient if statistics existed outside of history, but that's not the case. Statistics, as a lens through which scientists investigate real-world questions, has always been smudged by the fingerprints of the people holding the lens. Statistical thinking and eugenicist thinking are, in fact, deeply intertwined, and many of the theoretical problems with methods like significance testing---first developed to identify racial differences---are remnants of their original purpose, to support eugenics.*

**Statistical Significance** -- The New "S" Word

::: {style="font-size: 0.75em;"}

> "Significance, the new s-word, is overused and underdefined in the realm of connecting statistical results to the underlying science."

> "When used in statistics, significant does not mean important or meaningful, as it does in everyday speech."

> "I advocate a simple solution: Replace the s-word with words describing what you actually mean by it."
