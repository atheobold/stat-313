## ANOVA & MLR 

</br> 

In a two-way ANOVA, what are the two types of models you can fit? 

</br> 

How are these models similar / different from the multiple linear regression models we discussed? 

</br> 

## Inspecting MLR Models 

<!-- In a simple linear regression, if the slope is close to 0, what model would we fit instead?  -->

<!-- </br> -->

In a multiple linear regression, if the slopes of every group are the same, what model would we fit instead?  

- How would you justify this choice? 

</br>

In a parallel lines multiple linear regression, if the slopes of every group are 0, what model would we fit instead?  



## Inspecting ANOVA Models  

Why would a researcher choose to use a one-way ANOVA instead of a simple linear regression?
