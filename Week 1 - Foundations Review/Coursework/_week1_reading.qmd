## Chapter 1: Data, Types of Variables & Study Design

### Section 1.1

What is a summary statistic?

</br>

What is a case / observational unit?

</br>

What is a variable?

</br>

What is data?

</br>

What is a data frame?

</br>

How is a data frame "tidy"? 

</br>

### Section 1.2.2: Types of Variables

What are examples of numerical / quantitative variables?

</br>

What are examples of discrete variables?

</br>

</br>

What is an example of a variable recorded as a number which **is not** a
numerical variable?

</br>

What are examples of categorical / qualitative variables?

</br>

What are the "levels" of a categorical variable?

</br>

What is an ordinal categorical variable?

</br>

Give an example of an ordinal variable using the `county` data:

</br>

What is a nominal categorical variable?

</br>

Give an example of a nominal variables using the `county` data:

</br>

**Note: Ordinal and nominal variables will be treated the same in this course. I recommend taking more statistics courses in the future to learn better methods of analysis for ordinal variables!**

### Section 1.2.3: Relationships Between Variables

What does it mean when we say there is an association between two variables?

</br>

What does it mean when we say two variables are independent?

</br>

### Section 1.2.4: Explanatory & Response Variables

What does it mean for a variable to be an "explanatory" variable?

</br>

What does it mean for a variable to be an "response" variable?

</br>

### Section 1.2.5: Observational Studies & Experiments

What is an experiment?

</br>

What is a randomized experiment?

</br>

What is a placebo and how is it used in a randomized experiment?

</br>

What is an observational study? 

</br>

How is an observational study different from a randomized experiment?

</br>

What is a cohort and how is it used in an observational study?

</br>

#### Notes

In a data frame, rows correspond to: 

In a data frame, columns correspond to: 

</br>

True or False: A pair of variables can be both associated AND independent.

</br>

True or False: Given a pair of variables, one will always be the explanatory
variable and one the response variable.

</br>

True or False: If a study does have an explanatory and a response variable, that
means changes in the explanatory variable must **cause** changes in the response
variable.

</br>

True or False: Observational studies can show a naturally occurring association
between variables.

</br>


## Chapter 2: Sampling & Experimental Design

### Section 2.1.1: Populations & Samples

What is a population?

</br>

If a census was performed, how were observations sampled?

</br>

How is a sample different from a population?

</br>

### Section 2.1.2: Parameters & Statistics

What is a statistic?

</br>

What is a parameter? 

</br>

What is the relationship between a statistic and a parameter?

</br>

### Section 2.1.3: Anecdotal Evidence

What is anecdotal evidence?

</br>

### Section 2.1.4: Sampling from a Population

What does it mean for something to be biased?

</br>

How can a sample be biased?

</br>

How are observations sampled when a researcher uses a simple random sample?

</br>

What does it mean for a sample to be "representative" of the population?

</br>

What does it mean for a study to have non-response bias?

</br>

What does it mean for a study to have response bias?

</br>

How are observations sampled when a researcher uses a convenience sample?

</br>

#### Notes

- Someone must first be *chosen* to be in a study and refuse to participate in
order to have **non-response bias**.

- There must be a valid reason for someone to lie or be untruthful to justify
saying **response bias** is present. Yes, anyone could lie at any time to any 
question. Response bias is when those lies are **predictable** and 
**systematic** based on outside influences. An example would be surveying 
Cal Poly students and asking them if they have ever driven drunk. 

</br>

True or False: Convenience sampling tends to result in non-response bias.

</br>

True or False: Volunteer sampling tends to result in response bias.

</br>

### Section 2.1.5: Four Sampling Methods

How are observations sampled when a researcher uses a stratified sampling 
method? 

</br>

What is a strata and how is it used in stratified sampling? 

</br>

How are observations sampled when a researcher uses a cluster sampling method?

</br>

How are clusters made in cluster sampling?

</br>

How are clusters similar to and different from strata?

</br>

How are observations sampled when a researcher uses a multistage sampling 
method? 

</br>

#### Notes

Ideally, how should we sample cases from our target population? Using what
sampling method?

</br>

True or False: Random sampling helps to resolve selection bias, but has no
impact on non-response or response bias.

</br>

### Section 2.2.1: Principles of Experimental Design

What does it me for an experiment to control for a specific variable? 

</br>

What is a control and how is it used in an experiment?

</br>

What is randomization and how is it used in an experiment?

</br>

What is a confounding variable?

</br>

What does it mean for an experiment to have replication?

</br>

What is a replicate?

</br>

What is blocking and how is it used in an experiment?

</br>

What are blocks?

</br>

### Section 2.2.2: Reducing Bias in Human Experiments

In an experiment, what is a treatment group?

</br>

In an experiment, what is a control group?

</br>

What does it mean for an experiment to be blind?

</br>

What does it mean for an experiment to be double blind? 

</br>

What is a placebo effect? 

</br>

### Section 2.3: Observational Studies

What is a prospective study?

</br>

What is a retrospective study?

</br>

#### Notes

What are the four principles of a well-designed randomized experiment? 

</br>

True or False: Observational studies can show an association between two
variables, but cannot determine a causal relationship.

</br>

True or False: In order for an experiment to be valid, a placebo must be used.

</br>

True or False: If random sampling of the target population is used, and no other
types of bias is suspected, results from the sample can be generalized to the
entire target population.

</br>

True or False: If random sampling of the target population is used, and no other
types of bias are suspected, results from the sample can be inferred as a causal
relationship between the explanatory and response variables.
