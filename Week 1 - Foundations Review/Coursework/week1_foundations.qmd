Welcome!

In this coursework, you'll get a refresher on the foundational components of 
statistics and data, investigate how statistics is used in your major, and
think critically about the philosophy of statistical inference.

## Learning Outcomes 

By the end of this coursework you should be able to:

- describe observations, variables, and data matrices 
- explain the different types of variables a study can have 
- illustrate the difference between explanatory and response variables

- delineate the difference between a population and a sample
- compare and contrast different sampling methods
- outline what is necessary to make an experiment an "experiment" 
- characterize the differences between observational studies and experiments

- describe the difference between little "s" statistics and big "S" Statistics
- outline what "dichotomous thinking" is 
- illustrate how dichotomous thinking is used in Statistics
- explain issues with using the term "significant" in Statistics

# Data Refresher 

Let's start off by reading a refresher on some of the foundational concepts for 
data! 

`r emo::ji("book")` [**Required Reading:** _Introduction to Modern Statistics_ -- Hello Data](https://openintro-ims.netlify.app/data-hello.html)

`r emo::ji("book")` [**Required Reading:** _Introduction to Modern Statistics_ -- Study Design](https://openintro-ims.netlify.app/data-design.html)

`r emo::ji("book")` [**Required Reading:** statistics versus Statistics ](https://critical-inference.com/statistics-vs-statistics/)

## Chapter Reading Guides

`r emo::ji("pen")` [Week 1 Reading Guide](atheobold.github.io/stat-313/Week%201%20-%20Foundations%20Review/Coursework/_week1_reading.html)

## `r emo::ji("check")` Check-in

1. What are the different types of variables that can appear in a 
dataset? (select all that apply)

- discrete numerical
- ordinal categorical
- nominal categorical 
- continuous numerical
- discrete categorical

2. Just because a variable has numeric values, does not mean it is a numeric
variable. Which of the following variables appear numerical but behave like a
categorical variable? (select all that apply)

- zip code
- GPA
- height 
- year in school

3. Which of the following statements are true about observational studies and
experiments? (select all that apply)

- Experiments randomly assign the explanatory variable
- Observational studies randomly assign the explanatory variable
- Observational studies can make causal statements about the relationship
between the explanatory and response variables
- Experiments can make causal statements about the relationship between the 
explanatory and response variables

4. What are different methods for sampling from a population? (select all that apply)

- simple random sampling 
- stratified random sampling 
- cluster sampling 
- multistage sampling
- convenience sampling

5. Cluster sampling and stratified sampling both rely on grouping observations,
but have important differences. Match each method to how observations are
randomly sampled.

::: columns
::: {.column width="35%"}
**stratified sampling**

**cluster sampling**
:::

::: {.column width="35%"}
*groups of observations are created, groups are randomly selected, every
observation in the selected group is sampled*  

*groups of observations are created, observations within a group are randomly
sampled*

# Statistics in Your Field

`r emo::ji("play button")` [**Required Video:** How to Find a Peer Reviewed Journal Article (6 minutes)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ui8ibJ0Pkhs)

Now let's investigate how statistics is used in your discipline. 

Find a peer-reviewed article from a journal in your field that performs a 
statistical analysis somewhere in the paper. You **do not** need to be familiar
with the analysis they do. That being said, if you want to find a paper that
uses a statistical method we'll cover in this class, look for a paper that uses
"regression" or "ANOVA." 

The Library is a great resource for this! The following website [https://csu-calpoly.primo.exlibrisgroup.com/discovery/jsearch?vid=01CALS_PSU:01CALS_PSU](https://csu-calpoly.primo.exlibrisgroup.com/discovery/jsearch?vid=01CALS_PSU:01CALS_PSU) has a list of journals by discipline that are available through the
library. 

## `r emo::ji("check")` Check-in

Upload a PDF of your journal article to the Canvas assignment portal.

# The Philosophy of Statistical Inference 

`r emo::ji("play button")` [**Required Video:** Philosophy of Statistics (3 minutes)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K511BpyoTzU)

`r emo::ji("book")` [**Required Reading:** Our love of dichotomizing](https://critical-inference.com/our-love-of-dichotomizing/)

`r emo::ji("book")` [**Required Reading:** Science is Human](https://critical-inference.com/science-is-human/)

`r emo::ji("book")` [**Required Reading:** _Do We Really Need the S-word?_](https://www.americanscientist.org/article/do-we-really-need-the-s-word)

## Conceptual Questions 

Throughout the week, you will be asked to reflect on the following 
questions:

- What is **S**tatistics?

- What are two similarities and two differences between Statistics and 
Mathematics? 

- What is the role of Statistics in the progression of science?

- How is dichotomous thinking used in Statistics? What are two 
benefits and drawbacks of dichotomous thinking?

- What does it mean for an analysis to be "objective"? Do you believe 
statistical analyses can be objective? Why or why not?

- What are 4-5 synonyms of "significant" that come to your mind?

- What are two issues that you see with using the term "significant" 
to denote "small" p-values?
