--

> Scientists seek to answer questions using rigorous methods and careful
> observations. These observations – collected from the likes of field notes,
> surveys, and experiments – form the backbone of a statistical investigation
> and are called data.  

> Statistics is the study of how best to collect, analyze,

.larger[What you can expect in STAT 313]

This course will teach you the fundamentals of linear models---**simple linear 
regression, multiple linear regression, and analysis of variance**---and 
experimental design. You will extend the concepts covered in your Stat I course,
to:

* work with data (in R)
* create data visualizations (in R)
* create data summaries (in R) 
* create & critique statistical analyses

---

.larger[**"Doing" Statistics**] 

</br> 

Coding is a **huge** part of how doing statistics in the wild looks.

--

- Everyone is coming from a different background 

--

- Different aspects of the course will be difficult to different people 

--

- Use your peers to support your learning

What *criteria* would you use to *rank* yourself compared to everyone else
in this class?

Saying "this is not possible" or "this is not something we should be trying to
do" is not an acceptable answer for this exercise. I want actual criteria!

Be prepared to share some possible criteria.

.larger[Cooperative Learning]

is a structured form of small-group learning

--

- Roles relate to **how** the work should be done
  * Roles **are not** about breaking up the work intellectually
  
- Roles allow each person to contribute to the group in significant ways
  * Each person's participation is necessary to complete the task

Data were collected on thousands of loans made through the Lending Club
platform, a platform that allows individuals to lend to other individuals.

A total of 55 variables were collected on every loan that was made, including
information about:

- the borrower's employment, credit, current financial status, tax filings
- the loan's details, date of issue, balance, and current status
