## Data

The `ncbirths` dataset is a random sample of 1,000 cases taken from a larger 
dataset collected in North Carolina in 2004. 

Each case describes the birth of a single child born in North Carolina, along
with various characteristics of the child (e.g. birth weight, length of
gestation, etc.), the child’s mother (e.g. age, weight gained during pregnancy,
smoking habits, etc.) and the child’s father (e.g. age).
