# Model Selection Order

Based on my code, the model selection process should go:

`eval_completion` $\rightarrow$ `pic_color` $\rightarrow$ `gender`

Then, in Step 4 they will need to choose between `age` and `bty_avg`. Here is how their respective models should go:

`age` $\rightarrow$ `rank` $\rightarrow$ DONE

-   No variables add at least 1% (0.01) to previous model

`bty_avg` $\rightarrow$ DONE

-   No variables add at least 1% (0.01) to previous model
:::

## Question 1

**To earn a Success:**

-   fits other 6 models (rank, pic_outfit, pic_color, large_class, eval_completion, cls_level)
-   finds other 6 adjusted $R^2$ values
-   states top model includes **eval_completion** variable

*If they do not state the top model or what variable was chosen:*

> When comparing multiple models it is important to explicitly state what model was selected as the top model. This can be a simple statement like, "The top model was selected to have the following variables: ....".

## Question 2

**To earn a Success:**

-   fits 11 models that **include the variable chosen in #1 as an explanatory variable**
-   finds 11 adjusted $R^2$ values
-   states top model includes **eval_completion** & **pic_color** variables

*If they do not state the top model or what new variable was chosen:*

> When comparing multiple models it is important to explicitly state what model was selected as the top model. This can be a simple statement like, "The top model was selected to have the following variables: ....".

OR

> You need to state **every** variable that is included in your top model, not the name of the model that was fit.

OR

> Careful! Your model contains more variables than just gender! What are **all** the variables included in your top model?

## Question 3

**To earn a Success:**

-   modifies code to fit models that **include the variables chosen in #1 and #2 as an explanatory variables**
-   states top model includes **all** the variables they've chosen

*If they don't include a variable from #1 or #2 as an explanatory variable*

> Careful! You need to deciding what variable to add, given the variables you have already chosen! The variables you chose in #1 and #2 need to be included in the models you are comparing.

*If they do not state the top model or what new variable was chosen:*

> When comparing multiple models it is important to explicitly state what model was selected as the top model. This can be a simple statement like, "The top model was selected to have the following variables: ....".

OR

> You need to state **every** variable that is included in your top model, not the name of the model that was fit.

OR

> Careful! Your model contains more variables than just gender! What are **all** the variables included in your top model?

## Question 4

**To earn a Success:**

-   modifies code to fit models that **include the variables chosen in #1, #2, and #3 as an explanatory variables**
-   states top model includes **all** the variables they've chosen

*If they don't include a variable from #1, #2, or #3 as an explanatory variable*

> Careful! You need to deciding what variable to add, given the variables you have already chosen! The variables you chose in #1, #2 AND #3 need to be included in the models you are comparing.

*If they do not state the top model or what new variable was chosen:*

> When comparing multiple models it is important to explicitly state what model was selected as the top model. This can be a simple statement like, "The top model was selected to have the following variables: ....".

*If they state they added both variables that were tied:*

> You need to choose **one** of the variables provided!

## Question 5

**To earn a Success:**

-   modifies code to fit models that **include the variables chosen in #1, #2, #3, and #4 as an explanatory variables**
-   states top model includes **all** the variables they've chosen

*If they don't include a variable from #1, #2, #3, or #4 as an explanatory variable*

> Careful! You need to deciding what variable to add, given the variables you have already chosen! The variables you chose in #1, #2, #3 AND #4 need to be included in the models you are comparing.

*If they do not state the top model or what new variable was chosen:*

> When comparing multiple models it is important to explicitly state what model was selected as the top model. This can be a simple statement like, "The top model was selected to have the following variables: ....".

## Question 6

**To earn a Success:**

-   includes **all** variables from top model in regression

*If the model fit here differs from their top model, they **must** state why they fit a different model.*

## Prediction

**To earn a Success:**

-   make predictions using the top model from #6 (or #5)
-   if a different model is chosen then justification is provided for why
