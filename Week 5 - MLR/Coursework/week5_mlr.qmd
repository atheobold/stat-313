Welcome!

In this week's coursework we are going to build off the concepts we learned 
last week and delve deeper into linear regression. We are going to explore 
*multiple linear regression*, a statistical model where we have multiple 
explanatory variables and a single numerical response. We are going to refresh
how to visualize these types of models, practice fitting these types of models 
in `R`, and the learn how to interpret these types of models. 

## Learning Outcomes 

By the end of this coursework you should be able to:

- describe to someone what a multiple linear regression is
- outline how a categorical explanatory variable can be included in a simple 
linear regression
- visualize multiple linear regression models with one numerical and one categorical explanatory variable
- calculate the simple linear regression line for each group of a categorical 
variable
- outline how a second numerical explanatory variable can be included in a 
simple linear regression
- visualize multiple linear regression models with two  numerical explanatory
variables
- interpret the coefficient of each explanatory variable included in the 
regression model
- recite different methods that can be used to decide what multiple linear 
regression model is "best"
- describe the benefits and costs of using "model selection" for deciding on 
a multiple linear regression model

**Question 1** -- Based on the visualizations above, I believe the [interaction / parallel slopes] model is more appropriate because the slopes between the groups are [very different / very similar]. 

**Question 2** -- What type of model does the following code obtain?

```{r}
minority_lm <- lm(score ~ age * ethnicity, data = evals)
```

- interaction model
- parallel slopes model 
- simple linear regression model

</br>

The following is the output from the above regression model (from Question 2): 

```{r}
#| echo: false
get_regression_table(minority_lm)
```

</br>

**Question 3** -- The `intercept` line represents the [evaluation score / mean evaluation score] for [male / female / minority / non-minority] faculty. 

</br>

**Question 4** -- The `age` line represents the relationship between age and evaluation scores for [male / female / minority / non-minority] faculty. 

</br>

**Question 5** -- The `ethnicity:not minority` line represents the [mean / adjustment to the mean] evaluation score for [male / female / minority / non-minority] faculty. 

</br>

**Question 6** -- The `age:ethnicitynot minority` line represents the [slope / adjustment to the slope] for the relationship between age and evaluation scores for [male / female / minority / non-minority] faculty. 

</br>

**Question 7** -- The value of the `age:ethnicitynot minority` line (-0.004) [does / does not ] match the decision I made in Question 1 as there is [little difference / substantial difference] in the slopes between the minority and non-minority faculty. 

</br>

**Question 8** -- What type of model does the following code obtain?

```{r}
bty_lm <- lm(score ~ age + bty_avg, data = evals)
```

- multiple linear regression with two numerical predictors
- interaction model
- parallel slopes

</br>

The following is the output from the above regression model (from Question 8): 

```{r}
#| echo: false
get_regression_table(bty_lm)
```

</br>

**Question 9** -- The intercept represents the [] for professors whose age is __ and who have a average beauty score of ___. 

</br>

**Question 10** -- We interpret the value of -0.003 by age as:

For every [1 day / 1 year / 1 evaluation] increase in professor's [evaluation score / age / average beauty] we expect the [course evaluation score / mean course evaluation score] to [increase / decrease] by __, after accounting for [ethnicity / gender / average beauty scores].
