## 8.1 & 8.2 

**What is the chief difference between a bootstrap distribution and a sampling distribution?**

**Looking at the bootstrap distribution for the sample slope in Figure 13, between what two values would you say most values lie?**


## 8.3 

**What condition about the bootstrap distribution must be met for us to be able to construct confidence intervals using the standard error method?**


**Say we wanted to construct a 68% confidence interval instead of a 95% confidence interval for $\beta_1$. Describe what changes are needed to make this happen.**

Hint: I suggest you look at the normal distribution rules from the last chapter.
