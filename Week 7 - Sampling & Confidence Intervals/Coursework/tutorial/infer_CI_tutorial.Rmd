## Data 

Per the California Privacy Rights Act (CPRA), the salaries of employees of
the state of California are required to be public. We will revisit the 2019 
salaries of head coaches from CSU and UC universities introduced last week. 

First, let's load the `coaches` data set into your workspace and take a look at
what the data look like.

```{r load-data, exercise = TRUE}

glimpse(coaches)

```

## Section 1 

### Starting with one sample

For our investigation, we are interested in estimating the median salary for 
all CSU and UC coaches. In class we talked about creating the sampling 
distribution of the median salary, since I had the salaries of **every** CSU and 
UC head coach. 

Today, I've given you a simple random sample of 50 coaches from the master 
dataset of all CSU and UC coaches. This context should feel more familiar --- you 
are interested in estimating the value of the true median salary of all CSU and 
UC head coaches, given a sample of 50 coaches. 

The population median salary of all CSU and UC coaches is: 
`r median(coaches_master$'Total Pay & Benefits') %>% scales::dollar()`. Let's see how close our
sample median is to this population median! 

Use the `summarize()` function to calculate the median ``Total Pay & Benefits``
for your sample of 50 coaches. 

```{r sample-median, exercise = TRUE}

```

```{r sample-median-hint-1}
coaches %>% 
  summarize()
# What goes inside the summarize() function?
```

```{r sample-median-hint-2}
coaches %>% 
  summarize(median = median(`Total Pay & Benefits`))
```

Plotting the data is possibly more important than calculating the sample
statistic, since it gives us an idea of the distribution of these 50 salaries. 

Create a histogram of the salaries from the sample of 50 coaches. I've given you
some code to start with, but you'll need to add to it! 

```{r first-plot, exercise = TRUE}
ggplot(data = coaches, 
       mapping = aes(x = ___)) 
```

```{r first-plot-hint-1}
# Use the numerical variable we are interested in!
ggplot(data = coaches, 
       mapping = aes(x = `Total Pay & Benefits`)) 
```

```{r first-plot-hint-2}
# Add a histogram to the plot
ggplot(data = coaches, 
       mapping = aes(x = `Total Pay & Benefits`)) +
  geom_histogram()
```

```{r first-plot-hint-3}
# Make the histogram look a bit better with binwidths! 
ggplot(data = coaches, 
       mapping = aes(x = `Total Pay & Benefits`)) + 
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 75000)
```

## Section 2

Now, let's take our single sample of 50 and see what we might have gotten from 
other random samples! 

### One Resample 

We'll start with getting one bootstrap resample. To do this we take our original 
sample (stored in the `coaches` dataset) and resample with replacement 50 times. 
The `rep_sample_n()` function from the **infer** package helps us obtain 
one of these resamples. All we need to do is specify the `size` and `replace`
arguments. 

*Keep in mind: how large your resample should be and whether you should sample 
with or without replacement*

```{r one-resample, exercise = TRUE}
one_resample <- rep_sample_n(coaches, 
                             size = ___, 
                             replace = ___)
```

```{r one-resample-hint-1}
one_resample <- rep_sample_n(coaches, 
                             size = 50, 
                             replace = ___)
```

```{r one-resample-hint-2}
one_resample <- rep_sample_n(coaches, 
                             size = 50, 
                             replace = TRUE)
```

Let's compare our resample with our original sample. Your original sample had 
a median of `r median(coaches_master$'Total Pay & Benefits') %>% scales::dollar()`. Use the `summarize()`
function to find the median of this resample. 

```{r one-resample-median, exercise = TRUE}

```

<div id="one-resample-median-hint">
**Hint:** Remember to use the `one_resample` dataset!
</div>

### Multiple Resamples 

Now, let's take what we learned about creating and summarizing one bootstrap
resample and scale it up! 

First, we're going to create 500 different bootstrap resamples, each of size 50.
We're still using the `rep_sample_n()` function to do this, but now we specify 
the number of resamples we want with the `reps` argument. 

Modify your previous code to create 500 bootstrap resamples. 

```{r multiple-resamples, exercise = TRUE}
multiple_resamples <- rep_sample_n(coaches, 
                                   size = ___, 
                                   replace = ___, 
                                   reps = ___)
```

```{r multiple-resamples-hint-1}
# These are the options we used for one resample! 
multiple_resamples <- rep_sample_n(coaches, 
                                   size = 50, 
                                   replace = TRUE, 
                                   reps = ___)
```

```{r multiple-resamples-hint-2}
# We want 500 resamples! 
multiple_resamples <- rep_sample_n(coaches, 
                                   size = 50, 
                                   replace = TRUE, 
                                   reps = 500)
```

Now that we have 500 resamples we need to summarize each sample with a single 
statistic. In our investigation we are interested in the sample median, so
that's the statistic we will use. 

Calculate the median ``Total Pay & Benefits`` for each resample. The `multiple_resamples` dataset contains 25000 numbers --- 50 observations for 500
samples. So, to get each resample's median we need to `group_by()` the sample ID
column (`replicate`) **before** we calculate the median. 

```{r multiple-resample-median, exercise = TRUE}
multiple_resamples %>% 
  
```

```{r multiple-resample-median-hint-1}
# Make different groups for each sample
multiple_resamples %>% 
  group_by(replicate)
```

```{r multiple-resample-median-hint-2}
# Find the median of each group
multiple_resamples %>% 
  group_by(replicate) %>% 
  summarize(median = median(`Total Pay & Benefits`))
```
 
## Section 3

For confidence intervals, we'd like to have a method that is a bit more 
dynamic than what we've been doing with `rep_sample_n()`, `group_by()`, and 
`summarize()`. The **infer** package includes tools that help us create
bootstrap resamples, visualize the distribution of our bootstrap statistics, 
and find confidence intervals.

### The infer pipeline

Generating bootstrap statistics has a similar process to what we used
previously, but it has a very different feel. The process looks something like 
this:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
coaches %>% 
  specify(response = `Total Pay & Benefits`) %>% 
  generate(reps = 500, type = "bootstrap") %>% 
  calculate(stat = "median")
```

Let's walk through each of the components of the infer "pipeline."

__Step 1:__ `specify()` your response (and explanatory) variable(s)

This step declares to R what variable(s) you are interested in. For this
tutorial we are only interested in one variable: `Total Pay & Benefits`. In 
the future, we will include an `explanatory` variable to help explain the
variability in the response variable. 

![](images/specify.png)

__Step 2:__ `generate()` resamples

The `generate()` step takes your original data and generates bootstrap
resamples. It knows how many resamples to generate from the quantity specified 
in the `reps` argument. Additionally, it knows to sample **with replacement** 
when the `type` argument is set to `"bootstrap"`.  

![](images/generate.png)

__Step 3:__ `calculate()` bootstrap statistics 

Now that you've generated lots of bootstrap resamples, you need to summarize
them with a single statistic. That statistic is what you tell the `calculate()` 
function to find! There are lots of different statistics we will explore, but 
for this investigation our `stat` will be a `"median"`. 

![](images/calculate.png)

### Your turn!

Take what you've learned about the infer pipeline and create a new dataset, 
named `coaches_resample` that contains median salaries calculated from 1000 
bootstrap resamples. 

```{r infer-exercise, exercise = TRUE}
coaches_resample <- coaches %>% 
  specify(___) %>% 
  generate(___) %>% 
  calculate(___)
```

```{r infer-exercise-hint-1}
# Specify what your response variable is!
coaches_resample <- coaches %>% 
  specify(response = `Total Pay & Benefits`) %>% 
  generate(___) %>% 
  calculate(___)
```

```{r infer-exercise-hint-2}
# Generate 1000 bootstrap resamples!
coaches_resample <- coaches %>% 
  specify(response = `Total Pay & Benefits`) %>% 
  generate(reps = 1000, type = "bootstrap") %>% 
  calculate(___)
```

```{r infer-exercise-hint-3}
# Calculate the median for each resample! 
coaches_resample <- coaches %>% 
  specify(response = `Total Pay & Benefits`) %>% 
  generate(reps = 1000, type = "bootstrap") %>% 
  calculate(stat = "median")
```

## Section 4

Alright, our final step is to use our bootstrap statistics to calculate a 
confidence interval for the true median salary of all CSU and UC head coaches. 

A nice first step is to visualize what the distribution of bootstrap statistics
looks like. The `coaches_resample` object contains 1000 medians calculated from
1000 different bootstrap resamples. Let's use the built-in `visualize()` 
function to make a quick histogram of these bootstrap medians. 

```{r}
visualise(coaches_resample)
```

It looks like the majority of medians fall between
`r quantile(coaches_resample$stat, 0.05)` and
`r quantile(coaches_resample$stat, 0.95)`, but let's quantify this range with 
a confidence interval. 

The `get_confidence_interval()` function is what we use to find a confidence 
interval from a set of bootstrap statistics. This function takes three
arguments, (1) a dataset containing bootstrap statistics, (2) the level of 
confidence that should be used, and (3) the type of method to use when making 
the interval. 

This looks something like: 

<center>
`get_confidence_interval(bootstrap_stats, level = 0.95, type = "percentile")`
</center>

</br>

Using these tools, calculate a 99% confidence interval for the population median
using the 1000 bootstrap statistics you found previously. Use the percentile
method to calculate your confidence interval. 

When you are done, preview what your confidence interval looks like! 

```{r get-CI, exercise = TRUE}
coaches_CI <- coaches_resample %>% 
  get_confidence_interval(level = ___, type = ___)
```

```{r get-CI-hint-1}
# For a 99% interval your level is 0.99
coaches_CI <- coaches_resample %>% 
  get_confidence_interval(level = 0.99, type = ___)
```

```{r get-CI-hint-2}
# For a percentile CI you use the "percentile" method
coaches_CI <- coaches_resample %>% 
  get_confidence_interval(level = 0.99, type = "percentile")
```


__How would you interpret the interval you got?__
