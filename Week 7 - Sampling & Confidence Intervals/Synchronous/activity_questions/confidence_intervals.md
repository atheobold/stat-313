**_Question 1_**

Why do we resample *with replacement* when creating a bootstrap distribution? 

**_Question 2_** 

When we resample with replacement from our original sample what are we assuming
about our original sample?

**_Question 3_** 

What does one dot on a bootstrap distribution represent?

**_Question 4_**

What is the relationship between a bootstrap distribution and a sampling 
distribution?

**_Question 5_**

In Section 8.1.2, you see a distribution of the years of pennies for one sample
and one resample. Then, in Section 8.1.3, you see a distribution of the means 
of 35 different samples. 

Why is the bootstrap distribution nearly bell shaped and symmetric when the
distribution of the samples were left skewed? 

**_Question 6_**

In a bootstrap distribution we resample with replacement from our observed data
the same number of times as samples in the original data. If we were to change
our sample size in the process of creating a bootstrap distribution, what would
happen? 

**_Question 7_**

Where is a bootstrap distribution always centered? 

**_Question 8_**

How is a bootstrap distribution used to find a confidence interval?

**_Question 9_**

What quality of a bootstrap distribution do we need to look for to be able
to construct confidence intervals using the standard error method?


**_Question 10_**

What is one similarity and one difference between using a bootstrap 
distribution to find a confidence interval versus using a t-distribution?
