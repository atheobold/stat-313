## Section 1 -- Baby Birth Weights

**What is the process of obtaining one shuffled sample?**

</br> </br> </br>

**With a shuffled resample, once the values are written on the cards what happens? Why is this a necessary step?**

</br> </br>

**What process is used to shuffle the cards? Are the cards put back into the hat once they are drawn?**

</br> </br>

**How similar was the shuffled slope statistic (in Figure 2) to the original slope statistic found in the original data?**

</br> </br>

**Where was the distribution of 10 shuffled slope statistics (in Figure 3) centered? Why was it centered there?**

</br> </br>

**What does the word "permute" mean? How is this term related to the shuffling method that was used to obtain the slope statistic?**

</br> </br>

## Section 2 -- Hypothesis tests

**What general form does a null hypothesis take? i.e. what does the null hypothesis generally assume?**

</br> </br>

**What is the difference between a one-sided and a two-sided alternative hypothesis? How do you decide which to use?**

</br> </br>

**What is a null distribution?**

</br> </br>

**How is a null distribution created?**

</br> </br>

**How is a p-value related to a null distribution? i.e. how is a p-value calculated?**

</br> </br>

## Section 3 -- Conducting a hypothesis test

**When creating a null distribution, what are the sequence of functions you use?**

</br> </br>

**Why is the `hypothesize()` function used to make a null distribution but not for a bootstrap distribution?**

</br> </br>

**What does the `null = "independence"` input in `hypothesize()` mean? What is it assuming about the variables declared in the `specify()` step?**

</br> </br>

**What method is used to `generate()` new samples? i.e. what is input as the `type`?**

</br> </br>

**Why is the null distribution centered at 0?**

</br> </br>


**How was the p-value calculated using the null distribution?**

</br> </br>

**How was the significance threshold ($\alpha$) used to reach a hypothesis testing decision?**

</br> </br>

## Section 4 -- Interpreting a hypothesis test

**Why do we never accept the null hypothesis?**

</br> </br>

**What is a Type I error?**

</br> </br>

**What is a Type II error?**

</br> </br>

**If you choose a smaller value of  $\alpha$ what happens to your Type I error rate?**

</br> </br>

**If you choose a smaller value of  $\alpha$ what happens to your Type II error rate?**

</br> </br>

## Section 5 -- Comparing with confidence intervals

**Why do we look for 0 in our confidence interval?**

</br> </br>

**If our confidence interval contains 0 what decision would we have made in our hypothesis test?**

</br> </br>

**What is the difference between statistical and practical significance?**

</br> </br>

## Section 6 -- Theory-based hypothesis tests & confidence intervals

**How is the `std_error` column in the regression table calculated?**

</br> </br>

**How is the `statistic` column in the regression table calculated? What type of statistic is it?**

</br> </br>

**How is the `p_value` column in the regression table calculated?**

</br> </br>

**How are the `lower_ci` and `upper_ci` columns in the regression table calculated?**

</br> </br>

**What is the relationship between theory-based methods and simulation-based methods?**

**How is the `std_error` column in the regression table calculated?**

</br> </br>

## Section 7 -- Checking model conditions

**What are the four conditions that need to be evaluated for linear regression?**

</br> </br>

**What is a residual?**

</br> </br>

**What does it mean for the residuals to be independent?**

</br> </br>

**What distribution must the residuals look similar to?**

</br> </br>

**What does it mean for there to be "equal variance" in the residuals?**

</br> </br>

**What happens if one of these conditions is violated?**

</br> </br>
