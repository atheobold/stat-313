1. Why is the distribution of shuffled differences in promotion rates (in Figure
9.6) centered at 0?

2. When creating a null distribution, what are the sequence of functions you 
use? 

3. Why is the `hypothesize()` function used to make a null distribution but not 
for a bootstrap distribution?

4. What does the `null = "independence"` input in `hypothesize()` mean? What is 
it assuming about the variables declared in the `specify()` step?

5. A null distribution is created by resampling the original data
*without replacement*. How is this resampling done? How does this connect to 
the null hypothesis?

6. What is the relationship between $\alpha$ and a Type I error? Why is one 
benefit and one cost of choosing a smaller value of $\alpha$ versus a larger
value of $\alpha$?
