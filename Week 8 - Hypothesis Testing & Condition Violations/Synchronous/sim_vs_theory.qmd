.larger[.rhubarb[Why not always use theoretical methods?]]

--

.large[Theory-based methods only hold if the sampling distribution is normally
shaped.] 

--

.large[The normality of a sampling distribution depends **heavily** on model
conditions.]

##

.larger[What are these "conditions"?]

--

.pull-left[For a single mean, we are assuming:

- Independence -- The observations in the sample must be independent. 

- Normality -- The observations come from a normally distributed population. 
]

.larger[.gray[A Comparison]]

.large[In general, when the conditions associated with a using theoretical
methods are violated, these formulas will underestimate the true standard error
of the sampling distribution.]
