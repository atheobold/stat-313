## Course Description and Learning Objectives 

_Catalog Description_: Analysis of variance and regression analysis for students
not majoring in statistics or mathematics. Includes one-way classification,
randomized blocks, Latin squares, factorial designs, multiple regression,
diagnostics, and model comparison. 4 lectures. Prerequisite: Stat 217, Stat 218,
Stat 221 or Stat 312

_Expected Outcomes_:   

- Identify, describe, and contrast different study designs:
  * observational studies
  * one-factor completely randomized designs
  * randomized complete block designs
  * factorial designs  

- Analyze and interpret the results of analysis of variance (ANOVA) from
different study designs, including multiple comparisons of means

- Analyze and interpret the results of simple linear regression models, and
multiple linear regression models which use both quantitative and categorical 
predictor variables 

<!-- * Lack of fit   -->
<!-- * Transformations   -->
<!-- * Indicator variables   -->
<!-- - Understand and know how to use variable selection techniques in regression. -->

- Describe the assumptions of the ANOVA and regression models and evaluate
whether they are violated for a particular analysis.

<!-- * Residual analysis   -->

- Describe Type I error, Type II error, and statistical power in context; 
discuss how different aspects of a study design will affect errors and power

- Identify potential ethical issues surrounding data collection and analysis

- Create thoughtful univariate, bivariate, and multivariate data
visualizations to aid in the communication of statistical findings

- Carry out data wrangling tasks required to prepare data for analysis, 
including selecting variables, filtering observations, and mutating variables

- Understand the importance of reproducibility in scientific research, and 
collaborate in groups to create a reproducible statistical report
