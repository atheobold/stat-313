# Welcoming Classroom

I value diversity, inclusion and equity in this (and every) class. I hold the
fundamental belief that everyone is fully capable of learning and doing 
statistics. There is more than one way to address a statistical 
problem, and our learning will be richer by being open to different ideas,
rejecting stereotypes, and being aware of---in order to minimize---our biases.
I look forward to getting to know you all as individuals and as a learning
community.

# Course Organization

This class is organized into six units. The skills learned at the beginning of
the course will carry throughout the remainder of the course. I hope that you
are able to see the connections between the topics of the different units, since
they are all part of one big family---the regression family!


## Unit 1: Foundations of Statistics (Week 1)

This introductory unit has three big tasks, (1) review statistical and data 
oriented concepts you have (likely) seen before, (2) think critically about 
**why** statistics is used in science, and (3) think about **how**
(historically) statistics has been used for inference.  

Reading: Chapters 1 and 2 in *Introduction to Modern Statistics* (*IMS*), 
with supplementary articles


## Unit 2: Exploratory Data Analysis (Weeks 2 & 3)

This unit focuses on building skills for working with and visualizing different 
types of data. First, we will focus on categorical data--creating summary 
tables and barcharts. Next, we will turn our attention to numerical 
data--calculating summary statistics, histograms, scatterplots, and linegraphs. 

This unit will pair:

- Chapter 5 in *IMS* with Chapter 2 (sections 1-7) in *Modern Dive*
- Chapter 4 in *IMS* with Chapter 2 (section 8) in *Modern Dive*


## Unit 3: Regression Modeling (Weeks 4 & 5)

In this unit we *finally* begin exploring statistical methods. You will put the
tools you learned for wrangling and visualizing to work in the context of 
linear regression. We will start in a (likely) familiar context--linear
regression. Once we've explored the concepts of "simple" / basic regression 
we will turn up the heat and add some additional explanatory variables with 
multiple linear regression. 

This unit will pair:

- Chapter 7 in *IMS* with Chapter 5 in *Modern Dive*
- Chapter 8 in *IMS* with Chapter 6 in *Modern Dive*


## Unit 4: Foundations of Statistical Inference (Weeks 6 & 7)

This unit will start with Chapter 7 in *Modern Dive*, setting the stage for why
Statisticians care so much about variability. We will then use these ideas to 
walk through chapters 11 through 13 in *Introduction to Modern Statistics*, 
exploring different methods for summarizing the variability we might expect 
to see in different samples. 

We will use these avenues to explore concepts you have seen before: hypothesis 
tests and confidence intervals. However, the main focus of these concepts will
be on the idea of sampling variability **not** significance testing. We will
visit the ideas of p-values and significance testing, with a emphasis on making 
(and justifying) sound scientific decisions. 


## Unit 5: Inference for Regression (Week 8 & 9)

Now that we've discussed the ideas behind sampling variability and statistical 
inference, we'll explore these ideas in the context of linear regression. We 
will explore simple linear regression first, looking at how we can assess how 
"good" of a job our explanatory variable does in explaining the response 
variable. Next we'll discuss how we can extend these ideas to a regression with 
multiple explanatory variables--using model selection criteria. 

This unit will explore:

- Chapter 24 in *IMS* with Chapter 10 in *Modern Dive* 
- Chapter 25 in *IMS* 


## Unit 6: ANOVA a (Boring) Case of Regression (Week 10)

To wrap up the quarter, we will look at a special case of linear 
regression--ANOVA. In this special case, our regression will include **only** 
categorical variables as explanatory variables. We will first review how we 
compare the means of two groups and then connect with what we learned about
categorical variables in multiple linear to conceptualize how we can compare 
the means of three or more groups. 

This unit will explore Chapter 21 and 22 in *IMS*

# Course Components 

Canvas will be your resource for the course materials necessary for each week. 
There will be a published "coursework" page which you can access through RStudio
Connect. The page will walk you through what you are expected to do each week, 
including:

- textbook reading
- lecture videos
- homework questions
- quiz questions

Discord will be your resource for course discussions and questions.

Posit Cloud will be your resource for course lab assignments 

- data sets
- lab assignments
- group projects
- software resources

Zoom will be used for the midterm and final oral exams. 

## Communication 

Every Sunday evening there will be an announcement on Canvas letting you know
what is due over the next week, and the material we will be covering. The module 
for each week will be released on Sunday evening, so you can look over the 
content and see what the plan is for the week. 

We will use Discord to manage questions and responses regarding course content. 
There are channels for the different components of each week (e.g., Week 1 Lab 
Assignment). Please __do not__ send an email about homework questions or
questions about the course material. It is incredibly helpful for others in the
course to see the questions you have and the responses to those questions.
I will try to answer any questions posted to Discord within 3-4 hours (unless 
it is posted at midnight). If you think you can answer another student’s
question, please respond! 

Generally, I will work **either** Saturday or Sunday each weekend, and will work 
from approximately 7am to 5pm during the week. I will attempt to respond
to emails in 24 hours, but emails sent on a Saturday night may not be responded
to until Monday morning. If you don't hear back from me in 48 hours, assume I
did not receive your email and resend it!

---

# Weekly Schedule 

Each week in STAT 313 will, for the most part, look something like this:

**Individual Expectations**

```{r, fig.align = 'center'}
knitr::include_graphics('course images/individual_process.jpg')
```

**Group Expectations**

```{r, fig.align = 'center'}
knitr::include_graphics('course images/group_process.jpg')
```

## Individual Assignments 

### Readings and Videos

I favor a "flipped classroom," since I believe it give you more hands on 
experiences working through the concepts we are learning. Thus, you should 
expect to dedicate time early in the week to reading the course material and 
watching the necessary videos.


### Weekly Quizzes (Due Fridays at midnight)

Each week there will be a short (~10 questions) quiz over the reading and 
videos from the week. These quizzes are intended to ensure that you grasped the 
key concepts from the week's readings. The quizzes are not timed, so you can 
feel free to check your answers with the textbook and/or videos if you so wish.
You can attempt the quizzes three times before the deadline! 

### Tutorials

On the lab assignment weeks, I will assign a set of tutorials focusing on
specific skills in `R`. These tutorials provide a review of the concepts covered
in the textbook, give examples of how to work with data in `R`, and have hand-on
exercises where you will need to write the `R` code necessary to complete a
given task (with hints provided). 

The tutorials are work at your own pace, so you can complete them all at once or
slowly throughout the week. The lab assignments will require for you to put the
skills you learned in the tutorials to work, so completing the tutorial is 
necessary to complete the `R` code in each lab assignment.  

### Statistical Critiques

### Midterm & Final Projects

There will be two projects throughout the quarter, where you will be asked to 
apply the statistical concepts you have learned in the context of real data. 
Each of these projects will be done in the teams you have been working with in 
class. More details will be provided during class.

## Team-based Assignments

### Lab Assignments (Due Sundays at midnight)

Labs will be assigned approximately every other week, providing the opportunity 
to explore the course concepts in the context of real data. Lab assignments will
require for you to work through the tutorial for the week, thus the tutorials
should be started early! 

You will complete the lab assignments in the same teams you collaborate with 
in class. You will access the lab assignment through Posit Cloud, which you 
will be walked through during the first lab. Your group will be expected to 
submit your completed lab on Canvas. You will need to submit __both__ the HTML
and RMarkdown documents. 

#### Lab Assignment Grading 

I expect that you will approach each lab assignment seriously, investing 
the necessary time and energy to prepare your responses. Different from what 
you may have experienced, lab assignments are graded for "mastery" of the 
concepts. The degree to which you "mastered" each question is assessed with 
the following four-point scale. 

Score   | Justification
--------|--------------
Successful | The solution to the problem is correct, legible, and easy to follow, with all reasoning provided. Any error is trivial.
Growing | The solution shows growth toward mastering the topic; however, it is incorrect and/or incomplete. 
Not Assessable | Solution is missing or insubstantial, or the solution was attempted using an inappropriate methodology for the problem type.

Each Lab Assignment is aligned to multiple learning targets, which describe what
you should be able to do after taking this course. You’ll receive a score for
each problem on an assignment according to the **SGN** rubric above, as well as
feedback to help you improve.

After the first submission, you will have the option to retry any problems for
which you scored a **G**. A written reflection on how your understanding of the
problem changed will accompany any revision. If you receive an N on a problem,
or if you don’t earn an S by the second try, you can make an appointment with me
to meet during my office hours (or another agreed-upon time) to create a
reassessment strategy. You can schedule up to one meeting per week. 

You can submit **up to one** revised Lab Assignment per week, until Sunday, 
March 19 at 11:59 pm. 

### Lab Assignment Schedule

Lab                                     | Week
----------------------------------------|--------------
Lab 1 - Getting Started with RMarkdown  | Week 1 
Lab 2 - Summarizing & Visualizing Categorical Variables  | Week 2 
Lab 3 - Summarizing & Visualizing Numerical Variables  | Week 3 
Lab 4 - Linear Regression in R                         | Week 4  
Lab 5 - Using the infer package for Inference          | Week 7 
Lab 6 - Inference for Regression                       | Week 8 
Lab 7 - Model Selection                                | Week 9

# Working in Teams 

## Team Member Roles

Your team will be rotating group roles each week, so that one person does 
not act as the "team manager" for more than one week. Instead the following roles
will circulate each week, so that each member of the group is able to complete 
each role.

| Role         | Responsibilities | 
|---------------|------------------|
| Manager | Responsible for organizing the team work: making sure all roles were assigned and clear, scheduling meetings, and leading discussion of lab assignment problems. During the group discussions the editor is responsible for making sure everyone has a chance to contribute, asking quiet team members to speak up, asking loud team members to listen to others, and bringing the conversation back to the lab assignment if it deviates. |
| Recorder | Responsible for collecting, organizing, and recording answers to the assignment during the discussions, compiling the summary of the answers discussed, sending summary to editor. |
| Editor | Responsible for reviewing the draft summary provided by the case reporter, sharing the summary with the team, soliciting feedback from the team, and submitting the final assignment by the deadline. |
| Clarifier  | During the team meeting the clarifier should assist the group by paraphrasing the ideas presented by other group members, e.g. “Let me make sure I understand...”. The clarifier is responsible for making sure that everyone in the group understands the solutions to the problems. |


There will be confidential peer evaluations completed every two weeks. I will 
use these to check-in on each group's dynamics and ensure that everyone feels 
their voice is being heard. 

## Team Meetings

There will be time in each class for your team to work on the assignment for 
the week, however this time will not be sufficient to complete the assignments.
Therefore, every group is expected to meet for at least 2-hours outside of
class. 

__If you are not in attendance for *more than one* of your team meetings that 
week, you will be expected to complete that week's assignment on your own.__ 

My hope is that each member of the group looks over the week's assignment on
Monday while reading the week's chapter(s). Then, each member should have some 
initial ideas to propose by Tuesday's team meeting. During this meeting the 
reporter can begin the process of writing up the group's ideas. The reporter 
will then provide the editor with their summary of the group's ideas. As a 
team, you can choose to work together or independently on the assignment's 
problems between course meetings. The manager is responsible for scheduling
additional meetings, so that the editor is able to submit the assignment on
time.

#    Grade Breakdown

Your grade in STAT 313 will contain the following components.

```{r, echo = FALSE, warning = FALSE, message = FALSE, eval = TRUE}
grades <- tribble(
  ~category,  ~percent,
  "Homework", 5, 
  "Think Out Loud Recordings", 5,
  "Quizzes", 10,
  "Labs", 15,
  "Projects", 15,
  "Midterm", 25, 
  "Final", 25
  ) 

grades <- grades %>% 
  mutate(category = factor(category, 
                           levels = c("Homework", "Think Out Loud Recordings", 
                                      "Quizzes", "Labs", "Projects", 
                                      "Midterm", "Final")
                           )
  )

grades$location <- rep(1, 7)

grades %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = location, y = percent)) +
  geom_col(aes(fill = category), 
           col = 'black') + 
  guides(fill = FALSE) + 
  geom_text(aes(x = rep(1, 7),
                label = c('Group Discussions / Weekly Homework (5%)',
                          'Think Out Loud Recordings (5%)',
                          'Weekly Quizzes (10%)',
                          'Lab Assignments (15%)',
                          'Group Projects (15%)',
                          'Oral Midterm (25%)',
                          'Oral Final (25%)'),
                y = c(98, 93, 85, 72, 58, 38, 13))) +
  labs(x = '', y = 'Cumulative percent') + 
  theme(axis.text.x = element_blank()) +
  scale_fill_manual(values = brewer_pal)

```

__Note__: If you have more than three “0” grades due to turning assignments in
late, un-revised “Rs,” failure to participate in group collaborations, or
missed assignments, the highest grade you will earn for the class is a C-. 

---

# Other Policies

## What if I need to turn something in late?

Assignments and redos are expected to be submitted on time. However, every
student will be permitted to submit **one** individual assignment 24 hours late
without question. You do not need to contact me to use this allowance, but if
you find yourself in a position where you have used this allowance and you 
cannot complete another assignment by the due date,
__you are expected to email me__. Once you email me, we can work together to
find a deadline that is fair to both you and other students. If I do not hear
from you, I will take a 5% reduction in score for every day an assignment is
late, up to four days

[Deadline Extension Google Form](https://forms.gle/9LLe6EoiLUvFEsJaA)

<!-- insert blurb about five tokens -->

## What if I need to miss class?

I encourage you to attend every class session, but policies are for narcs. I put
a great deal of time into making each class session engaging and worth your
time. Attendance in this course is not explicitly required, but it degrades 
your team's trust in you when they don't see you in class. 

Here’s what you should do if you do miss a class:

- Talk to a classmate to figure out what information you missed
- Check Canvas for any necessary handouts or changes to assignments
- Email me with any questions you have after reviewing notes and handouts

If you miss a bunch of classes, please come talk to me. I’m working from the
assumption that you care and are trying, but something is getting in your way
(health issues? depression / anxiety? college stress?); let’s figure out what
that is and how I can help. 

## What if I have accommodations or feel that accommodations would be beneficial to my learning?

I enthusiastically support the mission of Disability Resource Center to make
education accessible to all. I design all my courses with accessibility at the forefront of my thinking, but if you have any suggestions for ways I can make
things more accessible, please let me know. Come talk to me if you need
accommodation for your disabilities. I honor self-diagnosis: let’s talk to each
other about how we can make the course as accessible as possible. See also the
standard syllabus statements, which include more information about formal
processes.

## How can I expect to be treated in this course? 

Following Ihab Hassan, I strive to teach statistics so that people will stop
killing each other. In my classroom, diversity and individual differences are respected, appreciated, and recognized as a source of strength. Students in this
class are encouraged and expected to speak up and participate during class
meetings, and to carefully and respectfully listen to each other. During the
first few weeks of class, we’ll work together to create a set of norms that will
govern our interactions with each other, to ensure that we’re always respectful
of everyone.

So that everyone feels comfortable participating, every member of this class
must show respect for every other member of this class. Any attitude or belief
that espouses the superiority of one group of people over another is not welcome
in my classroom. Such beliefs are directly destructive to the sense of community
that we strive to create, and will sabotage our ability to learn from each other
(and thus sabotage the entire structure of the course).

In summary: Be good to each other.

## What consititutes plagiarism in a statistics class? 

Paraphrasing or quoting another’s work without citing the source is a form of
academic misconduct. This included the `R` code produced by someone else! 
Writing code is like writing a paper, it is obvious if you copied-and-pasted 
a sentence from someone else into your paper because the way each person writes 
is different. 

Even inadvertent or unintentional misuse or appropriation of another's work
(such as relying heavily on source material that is not expressly acknowledged)
is considered plagiarism. If you are struggling with writing the `R` code for
an assignment, please reach out to me. I would prefer that I get to help you
rather than you spending hours Googling things and get nowhere! 

Any incident of dishonesty, copying or plagiarism will be reported to the Office
of Student Rights and Responsibilities. Cheating or plagiarism will earn you a
grade of **N** on the problem or assignment and will remove your ability to
submit revisions for that assignment. 

If you have any questions about using and citing sources, you are expected to
ask for clarification. 

For more information about what constitutes cheating and plagiarism, please see
https://academicprograms.calpoly.edu/content/academicpolicies/Cheating.

## I’m having difficulty paying for food and rent, what can I do? 

If you have difficulty affording groceries or accessing sufficient food to eat
every day, or if you lack a safe and stable place to live, and you believe this
may affect your performance in the course, I urge you to contact the Dean of 
Students for support. Furthermore, please notify me if you are comfortable in
doing so. This will enable me to advocate for you and to connect you with other
campus resources. 

## My mental health is impairing my ability to engage in my classes, what should I do?

National surveys of college students have consistently found that stress, sleep
problems, anxiety, depression, interpersonal concerns, death of a significant
other and alcohol use are among the top ten health impediments to academic
performance. If you are experiencing any mental health issues, I and Cal Poly 
are here to help you. Cal Poly's Counseling Services (805-756-2511) is a free 
and confidential resource for assistance, support and advocacy. 

## Someone is threatening me, what can I do? 

I will listen and believe you if someone is threatening you. I will help you get
the help you need. I commit to changing campus culture that responds poorly to
dating violence and stalking.
