# Welcoming Classroom

I value diversity, inclusion and equity in this (and every) class. I hold the
fundamental belief that everyone is fully capable of learning and doing 
statistics. There is more than one way to address a statistical 
problem, and our learning will be richer by being open to different ideas,
rejecting stereotypes, and being aware of---in order to minimize---our biases.
I look forward to getting to know you all as individuals and as a learning
community.

#### COVID-19 Addendum

I understand and appreciate the strange world we find ourselves living in today. 
Surrounded by a variety of factors, many of us find ourselves overwhelmed, 
frustrated, confused, and sad. I appreciate all of these outside forces you are
navigating, and will do my best to monitor the pace of our course so that no one
feels left behind. Yes, this may mean that we may not hit every learning outcome.
Instead, it is of utmost importance to me that you leave this course with an
appreciation for the complexities involved in building a statistical model,
grasp of the importance of good experimental design, and that you participate
in group conversations about statistical reasoning and problem solving.

# Course Organization

This class is organized into six units. The skills learned at the beginning of
the course will carry throughout the remainder of the course. I hope that you
are able to see the connections between the topics of the different units, since
they are all part of one big family---the regression family!


## Unit 1: Foundations of Statistics (Week 1)

This introductory unit has three big tasks, (1) review statistical and data 
oriented concepts you have (likely) seen before, (2) think critically about 
**why** statistics is used in science, and (3) think about **how**
(historically) statistics has been used for inference.  

Reading: Chapters 1 and 2 in *Introduction to Modern Statistics* (*IMS*), 
with supplementary articles


## Unit 2: Exploratory Data Analysis (Weeks 2 & 3)

This unit focuses on building skills for working with and visualizing different 
types of data. First, we will focus on categorical data--creating summary 
tables and barcharts. Next, we will turn our attention to numerical 
data--calculating summary statistics, histograms, scatterplots, and linegraphs. 

This unit will pair:

- Chapter 5 in *IMS* with Chapter 2 (sections 1-7) in *Modern Dive*
- Chapter 4 in *IMS* with Chapter 2 (section 8) in *Modern Dive*


## Unit 3: Regression Modeling (Weeks 4 & 5)

In this unit we *finally* begin exploring statistical methods. You will put the
tools you learned for wrangling and visualizing to work in the context of 
linear regression. We will start in a (likely) familiar context--linear
regression. Once we've explored the concepts of "simple" / basic regression 
we will turn up the heat and add some additional explanatory variables with 
multiple linear regression. 

This unit will pair:

- Chapter 7 in *IMS* with Chapter 5 in *Modern Dive*
- Chapter 8 in *IMS* with Chapter 6 in *Modern Dive*


## Unit 4: Foundations of Statistical Inference (Weeks 6 & 7)

This unit will start with Chapter 7 in *Modern Dive*, setting the stage for why
Statisticians care so much about variability. We will then use these ideas to 
walk through chapters 11 through 13 in *Introduction to Modern Statistics*, 
exploring different methods for summarizing the variability we might expect 
to see in different samples. 

We will use these avenues to explore concepts you have seen before: hypothesis 
tests and confidence intervals. However, the main focus of these concepts will
be on the idea of sampling variability **not** significance testing. We will
visit the ideas of p-values and significance testing, with a emphasis on making 
(and justifying) sound scientific decisions. 


## Unit 5: Inference for Regression (Week 8 & 9)

Now that we've discussed the ideas behind sampling variability and statistical 
inference, we'll explore these ideas in the context of linear regression. We 
will explore simple linear regression first, looking at how we can assess how 
"good" of a job our explanatory variable does in explaining the response 
variable. Next we'll discuss how we can extend these ideas to a regression with 
multiple explanatory variables--using model selection criteria. 

This unit will explore:

- Chapter 24 in *IMS* with Chapter 10 in *Modern Dive* 
- Chapter 25 in *IMS* 


## Unit 6: ANOVA a (Boring) Case of Regression (Week 10)

To wrap up the quarter, we will look at a special case of linear 
regression--ANOVA. In this special case, our regression will include **only** 
categorical variables as explanatory variables. We will first review how we 
compare the means of two groups and then connect with what we learned about
categorical variables in multiple linear to conceptualize how we can compare 
the means of three or more groups. 

This unit will explore Chapter 21 and 22 in *IMS*

# Course Components 

Canvas will be your resource for the course materials necessary for each week. 
There will be a published "coursework" page which you can access through RStudio
Connect. The page will walk you through what you are expected to do each week, 
including:

- textbook reading
- lecture videos
- homework questions
- quiz questions

Discord will be your resource for course discussions and questions.

RStudio Cloud will be your resource for course lab assignments 

- data sets
- lab assignments
- group projects
- software resources

Zoom will be used for the midterm and final oral exams. 

## Communication 

Every Sunday evening there will be an announcement on Canvas letting you know
what is due over the next week, and the material we will be covering. The module 
for each week will be released on Sunday evening, so you can look over the 
content and see what the plan is for the week. 

We will use Discord to manage questions and responses regarding course content. 
There are channels for the different components of each week (e.g., Week 1 Lab 
Assignment). Please __do not__ send an email about homework questions or
questions about the course material. It is incredibly helpful for others in the
course to see the questions you have and the responses to those questions.
I will try to answer any questions posted to Discord within 3-4 hours (unless 
it is posted at midnight). If you think you can answer another student’s
question, please respond! 

Generally, I will work **either** Saturday or Sunday each weekend, and will work 
from approximately 7am to 5pm during the week. I will attempt to respond
to emails in 24 hours, but emails sent on a Saturday night may not be responded
to until Monday morning. If you don't hear back from me in 48 hours, assume I
did not receive your email and resend it!

---

# Weekly Schedule 

Each week in STAT 313 will, for the most part, look something like this:

**Individual Expectations**

```{r, fig.align = 'center'}
knitr::include_graphics('course images/individual_process.jpg')
```

**Group Expectations**

```{r, fig.align = 'center'}
knitr::include_graphics('course images/group_process.jpg')
```

## Individual Assignments 

### Readings and Videos

I favor a "flipped classroom," since I believe it give you more hands on 
experiences working through the concepts we are learning. Thus, you should 
expect to dedicate time early in the week to reading the course material and 
watching the necessary videos.


### Weekly Quizzes (Due Fridays at midnight)

Each week there will be a short (~10 questions) quiz over the reading and 
videos from the week. These quizzes are intended to ensure that you grasped the 
key concepts from the week's readings. The quizzes are not timed, so you can 
feel free to check your answers with the textbook and/or videos if you so wish.
You can attempt the quizzes three times before the deadline! 


### Think Out Loud Recording (Due Sundays at midnight)

Every week I will post one "big picture" conceptual question from the content 
covered the prior week, which you are required to record your response to the 
prompt. You should think of this "think out loud" as the second check point for 
the content covered each week. 

Each recording will be done through FlipGrid. The recordings will have an 
associated Canvas assignment (posted in the week's module), which will direct
you to the FlipGrid application. You will need to use your computer audio to
record, and I would prefer that you use your video camera during your recording. 

Scores for this portion of the course will be allocated similar to that of 
homework submissions, where full credit will be given so long as you provide a 
response that demonstrates you have spent time thinking about the content. I 
will provide individualized feedback to your recording, letting you know where
you are on the right track and what areas you could review. 

I would like for you to think about these recordings as preparation for the 
course's oral exams. During these exams, you will be given 10-minutes to reason
through two conceptual questions, similar to the knowledge questions 
previously covered. Give these knowledge checks some honest effort! They help 
you study for the midterm and final exams, and the feedback I give you can build
your understanding **before** exam week. 

While grading I will look for explanations that provide great explanations and 
contact the students who provided these explanations. You will be asked if you 
are comfortable with me sharing your video with the rest of the course. You are 
permitted to say either "yes" or "no," as your grade is not dependent on this 
request. 

### Tutorials

On the lab assignment weeks, I will assign a set of tutorials focusing on
specific skills in `R`. These tutorials provide a review of the concepts covered
in the textbook, give examples of how to work with data in `R`, and have hand-on
exercises where you will need to write the `R` code necessary to complete a
given task (with hints provided). 

The tutorials are work at your own pace, so you can complete them all at once or
slowly throughout the week. The lab assignments will require for you to put the
skills you learned in the tutorials to work, so completing the tutorial is 
necessary to complete the `R` code in each lab assignment.  

## Team-based Assignments

### Group Discussions / Conceptual Homework (Due Wednesdays at 8pm)

You will be expected to regularly participate in groups in class, discussing and
working through questions associated with the content for the week. Your group 
will be expected to submit a document with your responses to each question given
that week. 

Homework assignments will be given full credit, so long as each question was 
"reasonably" attempted. A "reasonable" attempt requires that the responses to 
each question (1) reflect critical thinking about the central concept(s) of the 
question, and (2) provide a unique insight into the group's thinking. 

At the end of each week, I will provide every group with feedback regarding
their ideas, and I will provide a "summary" of ideas that stood out and key
misconceptions to the entire course. You should think of these collaborative
questions as your first "check point" in the week's content. You will get
feedback as you progress through the check points, so you have a better idea of
what you need to work on as you prepare for the exams

### Lab Assignments (Due Sundays at midnight)

Labs will be assigned approximately every other week, providing the opportunity 
to explore the course concepts in the context of real data. Lab assignments will
require for you to work through the tutorial for the week, thus the tutorials
should be started early! 

You will complete the lab assignments in the same teams you collaborate with 
in class. You will access the lab assignment through RStudio Cloud, which you 
will be walked through during the first lab. Your group will be expected to 
submit your completed lab on Canvas. You will need to submit __both__ the HTML
and RMarkdown documents. 

#### Lab Assignment Grading 

I expect that you will approach each lab assignment seriously, investing 
the necessary time and energy to prepare your responses. Different from what 
you may have experienced, lab assignments are graded for "mastery" of the 
concepts. The degree to which you "mastered" each question is assessed with 
the following four-point scale. 

Score   | Justification
--------|--------------
4       | __Master__ -- Outstanding work that exhibits comprehensive and thoughtful understanding of the content of the question, with an individualized perspective. Errors do not occur in the assignment.
3       | __Practitioner__ -- Work reflects a solid understanding of the content of the question. Work may not exhibit original perspectives. Several errors may occur in the question. 
R       | __Redo (Required)__ -- Work satisfies the requirements of the assignment while missing the spirit of the assignment. May be an incomplete rendering of the assignment. The work may contain inconsistencies or demonstrate limited understanding of the content. May be incoherent or poorly written. 
1       | __Novice__ -- The work shows a lack of understanding of the assignment.
0       | __No credit__ -- The problem was not seriously attempted. 

For questions that your team reasonably attempted but did not earn a
"Practitioner" score, your team will be requested to revise and resubmit your
response. Problems marked with an “R” have the opportunity to be redone and 
returned to earn "Practitioner" credit. Although you may have as many
opportunities as needed to correctly redo problems, your first attempt at redos
__must__ be completed and turned in within __two days__ (48 hours) after
receiving your lab assignment. 

For each problem marked with an “R”, you will be required to submit a redo form
in order to earn back a "Practitioner" score (3 points) on the problem. One redo
form must be completed for each problem. You will submit your revisions to the
__same__ assignment portal, along with a redo form for every question. 

Each homework assignment will receive a score that reflects the average 
points-per-question. For example, suppose your homework assignment has four
questions and you receive the following scores on each problem: 3, 4, 3, and 4.
Then, your overall score is $\frac{3 + 4 + 3 + 4}{4} = 3.5$. Suppose you
received the following scores (3, 4, 3, and R). Then, your initial overall 
score is $\frac{3 + 4 + 3 + 0}{4} = 2.5$ (Redo 1). 

__Do not__ interpret 3/4 as equivalent to a grade of 75%. This rubric is
intended to be about the quality of your work, not the percentage of points
earned. It is likely that students consistently scoring “Practitioner” on this
rubric will earn at least a B- in the course.

Letter grades will be assigned according to the following minimums: 3.75 (A),
3.0 (B-), 2.85 (C), below 2.85 (C-, D, or F).

__Note__: If you have more than three “0” grades due to turning assignments in
late, un-revised “Rs,” failure to participate in group discussions, or
missed assignments, the highest grade you will earn for the class is a C-. 

### Lab Assignment Schedule

Lab                                     | Date / Week
----------------------------------------|--------------
Lab 1 - Getting Started with RMarkdown  | Week 1 (Sept. 22)
Lab 2 - Summarizing & Visualizing Categorical Variables  | Week 2 (Sept. 29)
Lab 3 - Summarizing & Visualizing Numerical Variables  | Week 3 (Oct. 6)
Lab 4 - Linear Regression in R                         | Week 4 (Oct. 13) 
Lab 5 - Using the infer package for Inference          | Week 7 (Nov. 3)
Lab 6 - Inference for Regression                       | Week 8 (Nov. 10)
Lab 7 - Model Selection                                | Week 9 (Nov. 17)


### Projects

There will be two projects throughout the quarter, where you will be asked to 
apply the statistical concepts you have learned in the context of real data. 
Each of these projects will be done in the teams you have been working with in 
class. More details will be provided during class.

### (Oral) Exams

There will be two assessments designed for students to demonstrate their
understanding of content covered during the course. Each unit assessment will be
held virtually as an individual oral exam. These exams will require for you to 
talk through a set of open-response questions, demonstrating your understanding 
of the concepts. Each exam will follow the submission of the group projects, 
with the first occurring approximately halfway through the course and the second
taking place during finals week. 


---

# Working in Teams 

## Team Member Roles

Your team will be rotating group roles each week, so that one person does 
not act as the "team manager" for more than one week. Instead the following roles
will circulate each week, so that each member of the group is able to complete 
each role.

| Role         | Responsibilities | 
|---------------|------------------|
| Manager | Responsible for organizing the team work: making sure all roles were assigned and clear, scheduling meetings, and leading discussion of lab assignment problems. During the group discussions the editor is responsible for making sure everyone has a chance to contribute, asking quiet team members to speak up, asking loud team members to listen to others, and bringing the conversation back to the lab assignment if it deviates. |
| Recorder | Responsible for collecting, organizing, and recording answers to the assignment during the discussions, compiling the summary of the answers discussed, sending summary to editor. |
| Editor | Responsible for reviewing the draft summary provided by the case reporter, sharing the summary with the team, soliciting feedback from the team, and submitting the final assignment by the deadline. |
| Clarifier  | During the team meeting the clarifier should assist the group by paraphrasing the ideas presented by other group members, e.g. “Let me make sure I understand...”. The clarifier is responsible for making sure that everyone in the group understands the solutions to the problems. |


There will be confidential peer evaluations completed every two weeks. I will 
use these to check-in on each group's dynamics and ensure that everyone feels 
their voice is being heard. 

## Team Meetings

There will be time in each class for your team to work on the assignment for 
the week, however this time will not be sufficient to complete the assignments.
Therefore, every group is expected to meet for at least 2-hours outside of
class. 

__If you are not in attendance for *more than one* of your team meetings that 
week, you will be expected to complete that week's assignment on your own.__ 

My hope is that each member of the group looks over the week's assignment on
Monday while reading the week's chapter(s). Then, each member should have some 
initial ideas to propose by Tuesday's team meeting. During this meeting the 
reporter can begin the process of writing up the group's ideas. The reporter 
will then provide the editor with their summary of the group's ideas. As a 
team, you can choose to work together or independently on the assignment's 
problems between course meetings. The manager is responsible for scheduling
additional meetings, so that the editor is able to submit the assignment on
time.

  theme(axis.text.x = element_blank()) +
  scale_fill_manual(values = brewer_pal)

```

__Note__: If you have more than three “0” grades due to turning assignments in
late, un-revised “Rs,” failure to participate in group collaborations, or
missed assignments, the highest grade you will earn for the class is a C-. 

---

# Other Policies

## Late Work Policy 

Assignments and redos are expected to be submitted on time. However, every
student will be permitted to submit **one** individual assignment 24 hours late
without question. You do not need to contact me to use this allowance, but if
you find yourself in a position where you have used this allowance and you 
cannot complete another assignment by the due date, __you are expected to email me__. Once you email me, we can work together to find a deadline that is fair 
to both you and other students. If I do not hear from you, I will take a 5% reduction in score for every day an assignment is late, up to four days

You are also expected to participate in the week's team collaborations in a
timely manner. I will be able to monitor your involvement through your course 
attendance. If you find that you are unable to participate in the week's team collaborations in a timely manner, __please let your team know and contact me__.
Once you contact me, we can create a timeline that will both allow for you to
engage in the assignment and allow for members of your team to receive
feedback from you. 

## Behavioral Expectations 

This course will use group work and classroom activities to better engage your
understanding of the material. The environment for these discussions and
activities is expected to adhere to ground rules, so that we create an open
space where everyone feels welcome and supported, and comfortable with voicing 
their opinion. 

By participating in this community, students accept to abide by the classroom 
Code of Conduct and accept the procedures by which any Code of Conduct incidents
are resolved. Any form of behavior to exclude, intimidate, or cause discomfort
is a violation of the Code of Conduct. In order to foster a positive
and professional learning environment we encourage the following kinds of
behaviors in all platforms and events:

- use welcoming and inclusive language
- everyone participates and no one dominates
- listen to understand
- share airtime
- one speaker at a time
- disagree with respect
- be respectful of different viewpoints and experiences
- all ideas are valid
- gracefully accept constructive criticism
- treat everything you hear as an opportunity to learn and grow
- seek common ground and understanding

## Cheating and Plagiarism.

Simply put, I will not tolerate cheating or plagiarism. 

Any incident of dishonesty, copying, exam cheating, or plagiarism will be
reported to the Office of Student Rights and Responsibilities.

Cheating will earn you a grade of 0 on the assignment and an overall grade
penalty of at least 10%. In circumstances of flagrant cheating, you may be given
a grade of F in the course.

Paraphrasing or quoting another’s work without citing the source is a form of
academic misconduct. This included the `R` code produced by someone else! 
Writing code is like writing a paper, it is obvious if you copied-and-pasted 
a sentence from someone else into your paper because the way each person writes 
is different. 

Even inadvertent or unintentional misuse or appropriation of another's work
(such as relying heavily on source material that is not expressly acknowledged)
is considered plagiarism. If you are struggling with writing the `R` code for
an assignment, please reach out to me. I would prefer that I get to help you
rather than you spending hours Googling things and get nowhere! 

If you have any questions about using and citing sources, you are expected to
ask for clarification. 

For more information about what constitutes cheating and plagiarism, please see
https://academicprograms.calpoly.edu/content/academicpolicies/Cheating.
