**Instructor: Dr. Allison Theobold** -- call me [**Dr. Theobold**](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1m4e-2l76luAd9WrxiwCVf8-yf-co82dDSe1jHYf-NBo/edit?usp=sharing) or Dr. T! I use **she / they** pronouns.

# What is this class?

*Catalog Description*: Applications of statistics for students not majoring in statistics or mathematics. Analysis of variance including one-way classification, randomized blocks, and factorial designs; multiple regression, model diagnostics, and model comparison. Prerequisite: Stat 217, Stat 218, Stat 221 or Stat 312

**What will class be like?** 
We will spend class time exploring statistics concepts and tools and using those tools to answer questions, often with real data. This will happen in small-group work, full-class discussions, or mini lectures. We'll often explore data with technology, so **please bring a laptop**! There will also be time in class to discuss research articles that draw on the statistics topics we study.

# Welcoming Classroom

I value diversity, inclusion and equity in this (and every) class. I hold the fundamental belief that everyone is fully capable of learning and doing statistics. There is more than one way to address a statistical problem, and our learning will be richer by being open to different ideas, rejecting stereotypes, and being aware of---in order to minimize---our biases. I look forward to getting to know you all as individuals and as a learning community.

# What assessments will there be?

The main idea of assessment in this course is communication and feedback. There
are several different types of assessments or assignments in this class, but
they will all allow you to check your own understanding and progress towards the
learning goals, get in-depth feedback from me, and let me know where to spend
more time or approach something differently.

Each one is described briefly here, grouped into categories by course goal. See
["How do I earn a grade?"]() for an explanation of how these contribute to your
final grade. Our class schedule with topics and assessments is [here]().

<!-- figure out how to link to other sections -->

## Interpret and use statistical concepts

### Readings and videos (every week)

I favor a "flipped classroom," as it gives you more time to clarify and solidify
statistical concepts through hands-on exercises. Each week, you will read the
required chapter(s), completing a required reading guide to walk you through the
central concepts for each week. You are required to submit your completed 
reading guides by Monday at midnight.

### Concept quizzes (every week)

Each week there will be a short (~10 questions) quiz over the reading and videos
from the week. These quizzes are intended to ensure that you grasped the key
concepts from the week's readings. The quizzes are not timed, so you can feel
free to check your answers with the textbook and / or videos if you so wish. The
quizzes are **marked on completion** as complete or incomplete. You are required
to complete the concept quiz by Tuesday at noon.

### Tutorials (every week)

You can think of the tutorials as an "interactive" textbook, as they interweave
statistical ideas alongside examples of how to work with data in `R` and
hands-on exercises writing the `R` code necessary to complete a given task. 
Each exercise has hints available if you get stuck! 

The tutorials are work at your own pace, so you can complete them all at once or
slowly throughout the week. The lab assignments will require for you to put the
skills you learned in the tutorials to work, so you are required to complete
each week's tutorial **before** Thursday's lab. 

The tutorials are **marked on completion** as complete or incomplete. You will
submit a screenshot of the completion page at the end of the tutorial to confirm
that you completed the tutorial for the week. You are required to complete the
tutorial by Thursdays at noon. 

## Critically evaluate the use of Statistics

### Statistical critiques (every 2-weeks)

These assignments are case studies in which you will evaluate a data
visualization or statistical analysis, determining how well-performed and
presented the analysis was and making recommendations for improving or using the
analysis. Critiques are due roughly 1-week after they are assigned and should
take **1-2 hours**. You will **receive feedback** and a mark of **Success** or
**Growing** (elaborated more on later), and you will be able to revise based on
that feedback. There will be **four** total critiques.

## Perform statistical analyses to answer research questions

### Lab Assignments (every week)

Labs will be assigned on Thursday every week, providing the opportunity to
explore the course concepts in the context of real data. Lab assignments will
require for you to work through the tutorial for the week, thus the tutorials
are due before the start of class on Thursday. 

You will complete the lab assignments in the same teams you collaborate with in
class. You will access the lab assignment through Posit Cloud, which you will be
walked through during the first lab. Your group will be expected to submit your
completed lab on Canvas. You will need to submit **both** the HTML and Quarto
documents.

**Success / Growing Grading**

I expect that you will approach each lab assignment seriously, investing the
necessary time and energy to prepare your responses. Different from what you may
have experienced, lab assignments are graded for "proficiency" of specific 
learning targets, which describe what you should be able to do after taking this
course. You'll receive a score for each problem on an assignment according to
the **Success** / **Not Yet** rubric below, as well as feedback to help you
improve.

| Score                     | Justification                               |
|---------------------------|---------------------------------------------|
| Successful | The solution to the problem is correct, legible, and easy to follow, with all reasoning provided. Any error is trivial. |
| Growing    | The solution shows growth toward mastering the topic; however, it is incorrect and/or incomplete.                       |

## Synthesize statistical ideas

### Midterm & Final Projects

There will be two projects throughout the quarter, where you will be asked to
synthesize the statistical concepts you have learned in a formal statistical
report. Your critiques will help guide you toward how you do / don't want your
report to look. Each project will be done independently, and requires you to 
submit a project proposal and draft report before the final deadline. You are 
encouraged to use the feedback received on these assignments to improve your
final report. The final reports will be graded as Excellent, Satisfactory,
Progressing, or No Credit based on a rubric that will be shared with the initial
assignment. 

# Grade Breakdown

|                  | A-level              | B-level              | C-level              | D-level              |
|----------------|--------------|--------------|--------------|--------------|
| Guided Reading   | Regular Completion   | Regular Completion   | Irregular Completion | Irregular Completion |
| Concept Quizzes  | at least 9 completed | at least 8 completed | at least 7 completed | 6 or fewer completed |
| Tutorials        | at least 9 completed | at least 8 completed | at least 7 completed | 6 or fewer completed |
| Critiques & Lab Assignments  |  at least 11 Satisfactory | at least 10 Satisfactory | at least 8 Satisfactory | at least 6 Satisfactory |
| Peer Evaluations |  2 completed | 2 completed | at least 1 completed | at least 1 completed |
| Midterm Project  |  Excellent |  Satisfactory | Progressing | Not Completed |
| Final Project  |  Excellent |  Satisfactory | Progressing | Not Completed |

<!-- how many tutorials are assigned? -->

I will set + / - grades based on how close you are to the next higher (or lower)
letter grade. For example, if you meet all the criteria for an A but only 
completed 10 satisfactory labs and critiques, you would earn an A-. 

### Completing Revisions

After the first submission of your lab or critique, you will have the option to
retry any problems for which you scored a **Growing (G)**. A written reflection
on how your understanding of the problem changed will accompany any revision. If
you don't earn a **Success** by the second try, you can make an appointment with
me to meet during my office hours (or another agreed-upon time) to create a
reassessment strategy. You can schedule up to one meeting per week.

You can submit **up to one** revised Lab Assignment or Critique per week, until
Sunday, March 19 at 11:59 pm.


------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Classroom community and policies

### Weekly expectations 

Every Sunday evening there will be an announcement on Canvas letting you know
what is due over the next week, and the material we will be covering. The module
for each week will be released on Friday by 5pm, so you can look over the
content and see what the plan is for the week.

### Getting help 

**Discord:** We will use Discord to manage questions and responses regarding
course content.
There are channels for the different components of each week (e.g., Week 1 Lab
Assignment). Please **do not** send an email about homework questions or
questions about the course material. It is incredibly helpful for others in the
course to see the questions you have and the responses to those questions. I
will try to answer any questions posted to Discord within 3-4 hours (unless it
is posted at midnight). If you think you can answer another student's question,
please respond!

**Email:** I do my best to reply to emails promptly and helpfully. However, I
receive *a lot* of emails. To help both you and me, here are some specific 
expectations about emails: 

- Please tell me what course and section (by time or number) you are in!
- If you email me between 9am and 4pm on Monday through Friday, I'll try my best
to reply to you on the *same* day. 
-  If you email me outside of those hours, I will do my best to respond to you 
by the *next working* day. For my own mental health, I **do not** work on
weekends. Thus, if you send an email after 4pm on Friday or during the weekend,
you will not receive a response until Monday morning. 
- If your question is much easier to discuss face-to-face, I may ask you to meet
with me in my office or on Discord (at a time that works for both of us) rather
than answering directly in an email. 
- Include any relevant photos / screenshots / error messages / PDFs / links with
your email.

# Well-being, Access, and Accommodations

## What if I have accommodations or feel that accommodations would be beneficial to my learning?

I enthusiastically support the mission of Disability Resource Center to make
education accessible to all. I design all my courses with accessibility at the
forefront of my thinking, but if you have any suggestions for ways I can make
things more accessible, please let me know. Come talk to me if you need
accommodation for your disabilities. I honor self-diagnosis: let's talk to each
other about how we can make the course as accessible as possible. See also the
standard syllabus statements, which include more information about formal
processes.

## I'm having difficulty paying for food and rent, what can I do?

If you have difficulty affording groceries or accessing sufficient food to eat
every day, or if you lack a safe and stable place to live, and you believe this
may affect your performance in the course, I urge you to contact the Dean of
Students for support. Furthermore, please notify me if you are comfortable in
doing so. This will enable me to advocate for you and to connect you with other
campus resources.

## My mental health is impairing my ability to engage in my classes, what should I do?

National surveys of college students have consistently found that stress, sleep
problems, anxiety, depression, interpersonal concerns, death of a significant 
other and alcohol use are among the top ten health impediments to academic
performance. If you are experiencing any mental health issues, I and Cal Poly 
are here to help you. Cal Poly's Counseling Services (805-756-2511) is a free
and confidential resource for assistance, support and advocacy.

## Someone is threatening me, what can I do?

I will listen and believe you if someone is threatening you. I will help you get
the help you need. I commit to changing campus culture that responds poorly to
dating violence and stalking.

## What if I can't arrange for childcare?

If you are responsible for childcare on short notice, you are welcome to bring
children to class with you. If you are a lactating parent, you many take breaks
to feed your infant or express milk as needed. If I can support yo in navigating
parenting, coursework, and other obligations in any way, please let me know. 

# Attendance, Extensions, and Technology 


## What if I need to miss class?

I encourage you to attend every class session, but policies are for narcs. I put
a great deal of time into making each class session engaging and worth your
time. Attendance in this course is not explicitly required, but it degrades your
team's trust in you when they don't see you in class.

Here's what you should do if you do miss a class:

-   Talk to a classmate to figure out what information you missed
-   Check Canvas for any necessary handouts or changes to assignments
-   Email me with any questions you have after reviewing notes and handouts

If you miss a bunch of classes, please come talk to me. I'm working from the
assumption that you care and are trying, but something is getting in your way
(health issues? depression / anxiety? college stress?); let's figure out what
that is and how I can help.

## What if I need to turn something in late?

Assignments are expected to be submitted on time. However, every student will be
permitted to submit up to **three** individual assignments up to 1-week late, 
by completing the [deadline extension form](https://forms.gle/9LLe6EoiLUvFEsJaA).
When you complete the deadline extension form you will be required to state 
(1) what assignment you need an extension for, and (2) your proposed new 
deadline. **Your new deadline must be within 1-week of the original 
deadline.** All deadline extensions must be done through the form, so I can 
keep track of who has used their allotment of extensions. 

## Do I need to bring a computer to class? 

You are allowed to use technology in the classroom! In fact, we will often do so
as part of in-class activities. However, our class is held in a computer
laboratory, so bringing a laptop is not required. You are permitted to use the
lab computers, but if you would like to take notes on your computer / surface
 you are welcome to bring it to class. 

# Exceptations, Respect, and Integrity

## How can I expect to be treated in this course?

Following Ihab Hassan, I strive to teach statistics so that people will stop
killing each other. In my classroom, diversity and individual differences are a
sources of strength. One of the greatest failures of Statistics, historically 
and in the present, has been the exclusion of voices from the field. **Everyone
here can learn from each other, and doing so is vital to the structure of the
course.** Significant portions of this course involve group work and discussion
in class. Some discussions will touch on sensitive topics. **So that everyone
feels comfortable participating in these activities, we must listen to each
other and treat each other with respect.** Any attitude or belief
that espouses the superiority of one group of people over another is not welcome
in my classroom. Such beliefs are directly destructive to the sense of community
that we strive to create, and will sabotage our ability to learn from each other
(and thus sabotage the entire structure of the course).

In summary: Be good to each other.

### Working in teams

Your team will be rotating group roles each week, so that one person does not
act as the "team manager" for more than one week. Instead the following roles
will circulate each week, so that each member of the group is able to complete
each role.

<!-- update based on 331 roles -->

| Role \| Responsibilities \| \|---------------------------------\|---------------------------------------\|
| Manager \| Responsible for organizing the team work: making sure all roles were assigned and clear, scheduling meetings, and leading discussion of lab assignment problems. During the group discussions the editor is responsible for making sure everyone has a chance to contribute, asking quiet team members to speak up, asking loud team members to listen to others, and bringing the conversation back to the lab assignment if it deviates. \|
| Recorder \| Responsible for collecting, organizing, and recording answers to the assignment during the discussions, compiling the summary of the answers discussed, sending summary to editor. \|
| Editor \| Responsible for reviewing the draft summary provided by the case reporter, sharing the summary with the team, soliciting feedback from the team, and submitting the final assignment by the deadline. \|
| Clarifier \| During the team meeting the clarifier should assist the group by paraphrasing the ideas presented by other group members, e.g. "Let me make sure I understand...". The clarifier is responsible for making sure that everyone in the group understands the solutions to the problems. \|

### Peer evaluations

There will be confidential peer evaluations completed every three weeks. I will
use these to check-in on each group's dynamics and ensure that everyone feels
their voice is being heard.


## What consititutes plagiarism in a statistics class?

Paraphrasing or quoting another's work without citing the source is a form of academic misconduct. This included the `R` code produced by someone else! Writing code is like writing a paper, it is obvious if you copied-and-pasted a sentence from someone else into your paper because the way each person writes is different.

Even inadvertent or unintentional misuse or appropriation of another's work (such as relying heavily on source material that is not expressly acknowledged) is considered plagiarism. If you are struggling with writing the `R` code for an assignment, please reach out to me. I would prefer that I get to help you rather than you spending hours Googling things and get nowhere!

Any incident of dishonesty, copying or plagiarism will be reported to the Office of Student Rights and Responsibilities. Cheating or plagiarism will earn you a grade of **N** on the problem or assignment and will remove your ability to submit revisions for that assignment.

If you have any questions about using and citing sources, you are expected to ask for clarification.

For more information about what constitutes cheating and plagiarism, please see https://academicprograms.calpoly.edu/content/academicpolicies/Cheating.


# Course Organization

This class is organized into six units. The skills learned at the beginning of the course will carry throughout the remainder of the course. I hope that you are able to see the connections between the topics of the different units, since they are all part of one big family---the regression family!

## Unit 1: Foundations of Statistics (Week 1)

This introductory unit has three big tasks, (1) review statistical and data oriented concepts you have (likely) seen before, (2) think critically about **why** statistics is used in science, and (3) think about **how** (historically) statistics has been used for inference.

Reading: Chapters 1 and 2 in *Introduction to Modern Statistics* (*IMS*), with supplementary articles

## Unit 2: Exploratory Data Analysis (Weeks 2 & 3)

This unit focuses on building skills for working with and visualizing different types of data. First, we will focus on categorical data--creating summary tables and barcharts. Next, we will turn our attention to numerical data--calculating summary statistics, histograms, scatterplots, and linegraphs.

This unit will pair:

-   Chapter 5 in *IMS* with Chapter 2 (sections 1-7) in *Modern Dive*
-   Chapter 4 in *IMS* with Chapter 2 (section 8) in *Modern Dive*

## Unit 3: Regression Modeling (Weeks 4 & 5)

In this unit we *finally* begin exploring statistical methods. You will put the tools you learned for wrangling and visualizing to work in the context of linear regression. We will start in a (likely) familiar context--linear regression. Once we've explored the concepts of "simple" / basic regression we will turn up the heat and add some additional explanatory variables with multiple linear regression.

This unit will pair:

-   Chapter 7 in *IMS* with Chapter 5 in *Modern Dive*
-   Chapter 8 in *IMS* with Chapter 6 in *Modern Dive*

## Unit 4: Foundations of Statistical Inference (Weeks 6 & 7)

This unit will start with Chapter 7 in *Modern Dive*, setting the stage for why Statisticians care so much about variability. We will then use these ideas to walk through chapters 11 through 13 in *Introduction to Modern Statistics*, exploring different methods for summarizing the variability we might expect to see in different samples.

We will use these avenues to explore concepts you have seen before: hypothesis tests and confidence intervals. However, the main focus of these concepts will be on the idea of sampling variability **not** significance testing. We will visit the ideas of p-values and significance testing, with a emphasis on making (and justifying) sound scientific decisions.

## Unit 5: Inference for Regression (Week 8 & 9)

Now that we've discussed the ideas behind sampling variability and statistical inference, we'll explore these ideas in the context of linear regression. We will explore simple linear regression first, looking at how we can assess how "good" of a job our explanatory variable does in explaining the response variable. Next we'll discuss how we can extend these ideas to a regression with multiple explanatory variables--using model selection criteria.

This unit will explore:

-   Chapter 24 in *IMS* with Chapter 10 in *Modern Dive*
-   Chapter 25 in *IMS*

## Unit 6: ANOVA a (Boring) Case of Regression (Week 10)

To wrap up the quarter, we will look at a special case of linear regression--ANOVA. In this special case, our regression will include **only** categorical variables as explanatory variables. We will first review how we compare the means of two groups and then connect with what we learned about categorical variables in multiple linear to conceptualize how we can compare the means of three or more groups.

This unit will explore Chapter 21 and 22 in *IMS*
