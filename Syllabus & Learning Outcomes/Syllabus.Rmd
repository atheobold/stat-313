## Instructor Contact Information

- Allison Theobold, Ph.D
-	Email: atheobol@calpoly.edu
-	Office: Zoom

## Course Meetings

This is an asynchronous course which has no "formal" meeting times. I will be 
offering two weekly meetings, one _`R` Help Session_ and one _Weekly Review Session_. 

Each of these meetings will be held on Wednesdays on Zoom and recorded for those
who cannot attend. The meeting times will be determined from the course survey 
administered during the first week. 

## Office Hours

__All office hours will take place on Zoom.__

Regular weekly office hours will be held:

Day        | Time
-----------|------------------
Mondays    | 1:30 pm – 2:30 pm
Tuesdays   | 1:30 pm – 2:30 pm
Thursdays  | 1:30 pm – 2:30 pm

I am available for individual appointments on Mondays and Thursdays outside of
these time slots, but appointments __must__ be made made _at least_ 24 hours
in advance through Calendly, using the following link: 
<https://calendly.com/allisontheobold> 

## Required Materials 

For this course we will be using one main textbook, accompanied by additional 
resources. All of the materials are free! 

```{r, out.width = '20%', fig.align = 'center', echo = FALSE, eval = TRUE}
knitr::include_graphics('course images/open_intro.png')
```

Çetinkaya-Rundel, Diez, and Hardin, __Introduction to Modern Statistics__. 
<https://openintro-ims.netlify.app/>

### Additional Materials 

```{r, out.width = '30%', fig.align = 'center', echo = FALSE, eval = TRUE}
knitr::include_graphics('course images/modern_dive.png')
```

Ismay & Kim, __Modern Dive: Statistical Inference via Data Science__. 
<https://moderndive.com>. 

## Required Technology 

- `R` is the statistical software we will be using in this course 
(<https://cran.r-project.org/>). 

- RStudio (<https://rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/>) is the most popular
way to interact with the `R` software. To function correctly, RStudio needs `R`
and therefore both need to be installed on your computer.

- If you are unable to install `R` and RStudio on your computer, you can use Cal
Poly's Virtual Computer Labs 
(<https://tech.calpoly.edu/virtual-computer-labs-appstream>). RStudio is
available in the "Computational" labs. You will need to use a two-factor log-in 
(Cal Poly + Duo Mobile), which will then take you to a list of applications. 
When you select RStudio, the page will load for 2-4 minutes 
(`r emo::ji("sad")`). Once you are in, you can work in RStudio the same way 
you would on your laptop, *except* everything you make during a session 
__cannot be accessed later__. 

- Canvas will be used for weekly discussions / homework, weekly quizzes, and 
submissions for lab assignments and group projects.
- Zoom will be used for weekly review sessions, office hours, and oral exams. 

## Welcoming Classroom

I value diversity, social justice, inclusion and equity in this (and every)
class. I hold the fundamental belief that everyone is fully capable of engaging
in and mastering material. There is more than one way to address a statistical 
problem, and our learning will be richer by remaining open to different ideas,
by rejecting stereotypes, and being aware of--in order to minimize--our biases.
I look forward to getting to know you all as individuals and as a learning
community. 

## Course Description and Learning Objectives 

_Catalog Description_: Analysis of variance and regression analysis for students
not majoring in statistics or mathematics. Includes one-way classification,
randomized blocks, Latin squares, factorial designs, multiple regression,
diagnostics, and model comparison. 4 lectures. Prerequisite: Stat 217, Stat 218,
Stat 221 or Stat 312

_Expected Outcomes_:   

- Identify, describe, and contrast different study designs:
  * observational studies
  * one-factor completely randomized designs
  * randomized complete block designs
  * factorial designs  

- Analyze and interpret the results of analysis of variance (ANOVA) from
different study designs, including multiple comparisons of means

- Analyze and interpret the results of simple linear regression models, and
multiple linear regression models which use both quantitative and categorical 
predictor variables   
  * Lack of fit
  * Transformations
  * Indicator variables

- Understand and know how to use variable selection techniques in regression.

- Describe the assumptions of the ANOVA and regression models and evaluate
whether they are violated for a particular analysis.

<!-- * Residual analysis   -->

- Describe Type I error, Type II error, and statistical power in context; 
discuss how different aspects of a study design will affect errors and power

- Identify potential ethical issues surrounding data collection and analysis

- Create thoughtful univariate, bivariate, and multivariate data
visualizations to aid in the communication of statistical findings

- Carry out data wrangling tasks required to prepare data for analysis, 
including selecting variables, filtering observations, and mutating variables

- Understand the importance of reproducibility in scientific research, and 
collaborate in groups to create a reproducible statistical report

#### COVID-19 Addendum

I understand and appreciate the strange world we find ourselves living in today. 
Surrounded by a variety of factors, many of us find ourselves overwhelmed, 
frustrated, confused, and sad. I appreciate all of these outside forces you are
navigating, and will do my best to monitor the pace of our course so that no one
feels left behind. Yes, this may mean that we may not hit every learning outcome.
Instead, it is of utmost importance to me that you leave this course with an
appreciation for the complexities involved in building a statistical model,
grasp of the importance of good experimental design, and that you participate
in group conversations about statistical reasoning and problem solving. 

## Course Components 

Canvas will be your main resource for asynchronous course materials:

- class notes
- lecture videos
- discussion posts
- data sets
- lab assignments
- group projects
- software resources

Zoom will be the main resource for synchronous course meetings:

- course review sessions
- oral exams

### Communication 

Every Sunday evening there will be an announcement on Canvas letting you know
what is due over the next week, and the material we will be covering. The module 
for each week will be released on Sunday evening, so you can look over the 
content and strategize how you will use your time. 

We will use discussion channels in Canvas to manage questions and
responses regarding course content. Please __do not__ send an email about
homework questions or questions about the course material. It will be very
helpful to others in the course to see the questions you have and the responses
to those questions. I will try to answer any questions posted to Canvas within
12 hours. If you think you can answer another student’s question, please
respond. I will correct any inaccurate responses. If you have a question about
something, the discussion channels are the first place you should go. Personal
matters may be sent via email.

Generally, I will work **either** Saturday or Sunday each weekend, and will work 
from approximately 7am to 4pm (PST) during the week. I will attempt to respond
to emails in 24 hours, but emails sent on a Saturday night may not be responded
to until Monday morning. If you don't hear back from me in 48 hours, assume I
did not receive your email and resend it!

### Weekly Schedule 

Each week in STAT 313 will, for the most part, look something like this:

```{r, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE, eval = FALSE}
grViz("digraph {
  
graph[layout = dot, rankdir = LR]

node [shape = rectangle, style = filled, fillcolor = LightBlue]
node[fontname = 'helvetica', width = 2, height = 1]

videos [label = 'Monday: \n Read chapter \n Watch lecture video(s)', fillcolor = '#e40303']
post1 [label = 'Tuesday: \n Contribute to weekly \n group discussion / homework', fillcolor = '#ff8c00']
post2 [label = 'Begin Lab Assignment \n or R Tutorial', fillcolor = '#008026']
in_person [label = 'Wednesday: \n Attend / Watch course review \n & R help session', fillcolor = '#ffed00']
homework [label =  'Friday: \n Submit group discussion responses', fillcolor = '#004dff']
lab [label =  'Sunday: \n Submit lab assignment', fillcolor = '#750787']

videos -> post1 -> post2 -> in_person -> homework -> lab
}")
```

```{r, out.width = '100%', fig.align = 'center'}
knitr::include_graphics('course images/weekly_flow.PNG')
```

### Readings and Videos

As this is an asynchronous course, we will be using a "flipped class" format. 
This means I will  provide you with readings, pre-recorded videos, and guided
tutorials for you to watch, read, and do on your own time. You are expected to
complete the readings, watch the videos, and/or attempt the tutorials __before__
our weekly in-person review sessions. 

### Weekly Group Discussions / Homework Assignments 

You will be expected to regularly participate in discussion groups on Canvas to 
complete a set of questions associated with the content for the week. The 
questions for each week will be shared with your group through a Google Doc. 
You can access the document through the "Collaborations" tab in Canvas. 

My hope is that each member of the group makes an initial contribution by
Tuesday or Wednesday, so everyone can read through the posts and see what
they would modify or add. The group then has until Friday at 11:59pm to submit
your final responses. 

Homework assignments will be given full credit, so long as each question was 
"reasonably" attempted. A "reasonable" attempt requires that the responses to 
each question (1) reflect critical thinking about the central concept(s) of the 
question, and (2) provide a unique insight into the group's thinking. 

At the end of each week, I will provide every group with feedback regarding
their ideas, and I will provide a "summary" of ideas that stood out and key
misconceptions to the entire course. You should think of these collaborative
questions as your first "check point" in the week's content. You will get
feedback as you progress through the check points, so you have a better idea of
what you need to work on as you prepare for the exams

### Knowledge Checks

Every week I will post one "big picture" conceptual question from the content 
covered the prior week, which you are required to record your response to the 
prompt. You should think of this "knowledge check" as the second check point for 
the content covered each week. 

Each recording will be done through FlipGrid. Each recording will have an 
associated Canvas assignment, which will direct you to the FlipGrid application. 
You will need to use your computer audio to record, and I would prefer that 
you use your video camera during your recording. 

Scores for this portion of the course will be allocated similar to that of 
homework submissions, where full credit will be given so long as you provide a 
response that demonstrates you have spent time thinking about the content. I 
will provide individualized feedback to your recording, letting you know where
you are on the right track and what areas you could review. 

### Weekly Quizzes

Each week there will be a short (~10 questions) quiz over the reading and 
videos from the week. These quizzes are intended to ensure that you grasped the 
key concepts from the week's readings. The quizzes are not timed, so you can 
feel free to check your answers with the textbook and/or videos if you so wish. 

### Tutorials

On the weeks where there are no lab assignments, I will assign a set of 
tutorials focusing on specific skills in `R`. These tutorials provide a 
review of the concepts covered in the textbook, give examples of how to work 
with data in `R`, and have hand-on exercises where you will need to write the 
`R` code necessary to complete a given task (with hints provided). 

The tutorials are work at your own pace, so you can complete them all at once or
slowly throughout the week. There are no submissions for completing the
tutorials, but the skills you learn in these tutorials are necessary for 
completing the `R` code in each lab assignment.  

### Labs Assignments

Labs will be assigned every other week, providing the opportunity to explore 
the course concepts in the context of real data. Lab assignments will require
`R` for completion, and thus should be started early.  

You are expected to submit your lab solutions electronically to Canvas as
__both__ an HTML and an RMarkdown document. 

#### Lab Assignment Grading 

I expect that you will approach each lab assignment seriously, investing 
the necessary time and energy to prepare your responses. Different from what 
you may have experienced, lab assignments are graded for "mastery" of the 
concepts. The degree to which you "mastered" each question is assessed with 
the following four-point scale. 

Score   | Justification
--------|--------------
4       | __Master__ -- Outstanding work that exhibits comprehensive and thoughtful understanding of the content of the question, with an individualized perspective. Errors do not occur in the assignment.
3       | __Practitioner__ -- Work reflects a solid understanding of the content of the question. Work may not exhibit original perspectives. Several errors may occur in the question. 
R       | __Redo (Required)__ -- Work satisfies the requirements of the assignment while missing the spirit of the assignment. May be an incomplete rendering of the assignment. The work may contain inconsistencies or demonstrate limited understanding of the content. May be incoherent or poorly written. 
1       | __Novice__ -- The work shows a lack of understanding of the assignment.
0       | __No credit__ -- The problem was not seriously attempted. 

</br>

For questions that you reasonably attempted but did not earn a "Practitioner"
score, you will be requested to revise and resubmit your response. Problems
marked with an “R” have the opportunity to be redone and returned to 
earn "Practitioner" credit. Although you may have as many opportunities as
needed to correctly redo problems, your first attempt at redos __must__ be
completed and turned in within __two days__ (48 hours) after receiving your
lab assignment. 

For each problem marked with an “R”, you will be required to
submit a redo form in order to earn back a "Practitioner" score (3 points) on
the problem. One redo form must be completed for each problem. You will 
submit your revisions to the __same__ assignment portal, along with a redo form 
for every question. 

Each homework assignment will receive a score that reflects the average 
points-per-question. For example, suppose your homework assignment has four
questions and you receive the following scores on each problem: 3, 4, 3, and 4.
Then, your overall score is (3+4+3+4)/4 = 3.5. Suppose you received the
following scores (3, 4, 3, and R). Then, your initial overall score is
(3+4+3+0)/4 = 2.5 (Redo 1). 

__Do not__ interpret 3/4 as equivalent to a grade of 75%. This rubric is
intended to be about the quality of your work, not the percentage of points
earned. It is likely that students consistently scoring “Practitioner” on this
rubric will earn at least a B- in the course.

Letter grades will be assigned according to the following minimums: 3.75 (A),
3.0 (B-), 2.85 (C), below 2.85 (C-, D, or F).

__Note__: If you have more than three “0” grades due to turning assignments in
late, un-revised “Rs,” class absences resulting in “0” participation grade, or
missed assignments, the highest grade you will earn for the class is a C-. 


### Projects

There will be 2 projects throughout the quarter, where you will be asked to 
apply the statistical concepts you have learned in the context of real data. 
Each of these projects will be done in groups of 3-4. More details will be 
provided during class.

### (Oral) Exams

There will be 2 assessments designed for students to demonstrate their
understanding of content covered during the course. Each unit assessment will be
held virtually as an individual oral exam. These exams will require for you to 
talk through a set of open-response questions, demonstrating your understanding 
of the concepts. Each exam will follow the submission of the group projects, 
with the first occurring approximately halfway through the course and the second
taking place during finals week. 

## Course Assessment 

Your grade in STAT 313 will contain the following components.

```{r, echo = FALSE, warning = FALSE, message = FALSE, eval = TRUE}
grades <- tribble(
  ~category,  ~percent,
  "Homework", 5, 
  "Knowledge Checks", 5,
  "Quizzes", 10,
  "Labs", 15,
  "Projects", 15,
  "Midterm", 25, 
  "Final", 25
  ) 

grades <- grades %>% 
  mutate(category = factor(category, 
                           levels = c("Homework", "Knowledge Checks", 
                                      "Quizzes", "Labs", "Projects", 
                                      "Midterm", "Final")
                           )
  )

grades$location <- rep(1, 7)

grades %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = location, y = percent)) +
  geom_col(aes(fill = category), 
           col = 'black') + 
  guides(fill = FALSE) + 
  geom_text(aes(x = rep(1, 7),
                label = c('Group Discussions / Weekly Homework (5%)',
                          'Weekly Knowledge Checks (5%)',
                          'Weekly Quizzes (10%)',
                          'Lab Assignments (15%)',
                          'Group Projects (15%)',
                          'Oral Midterm (25%)',
                          'Oral Final (25%)'),
                y = c(98, 93, 85, 72, 58, 38, 13))) +
  labs(x = '', y = 'Cumulative percent') + 
  theme(axis.text.x = element_blank()) +
  scale_fill_manual(values = brewer_pal)

```

## Late Work Policy 

Homework and redos are expected to be submitted on time. However, every student 
will be permitted to submit **one** assignment 24 hours late without question.
You do not need to contact me to use this allowance, but if you find 
yourself in a position where you have use this allowance and you cannot complete
the assignment by the due date, __you are expected to email me__. Once you email
me, we can work together to find a deadline that is fair to both you and other 
students. If I do not hear from you, I will take a 5% reduction in score for
every day an assignment is late, up to four days

You are also expected to participate in the week's group discussions in a timely 
manner. I will be able to track the change in the Google Doc to see if / when 
every member of the group contributed. If you find that you are unable to 
participate in the week's discussion posts in a timely manner, 
__please contact me__. Once you contact me, we can create a timeline that will
both allow for you to participate in the discussions and allow for members of
your group to receive feedback from you. 


## Time Dedication Expectations

In a face-to-face lecture course like STAT 313, each unit of credit represents
one hour of in class instruction and approximately 2-3 hours of work outside of
class per week. This equals approximately 16 hours of student work for a 4-unit
class: 4 hours in-class and approximately 12 hours outside of class each week.

For a 4-unit asynchronous, I expect you to work approximately 1-3 hours per day
(Mon-Friday), plus another 3-6 hours over the weekend (Sat-Sun). I will attempt
to follow this guideline as I develop and post materials for the course, but
please reach out if the time you are spending on the materials for this course
falls far beyond these time guidelines! 

## Behavioral Expectations 

This course will use group work and classroom activities to better engage your
understanding of the material. The environment for these discussions and
activities is expected to adhere to ground rules, so that we create an open
space where everyone feels welcome and supported, and comfortable with voicing 
their opinion. 

By participating in this community, students accept to abide by the classroom 
Code of Conduct and accept the procedures by which any Code of Conduct incidents
are resolved. Any form of behavior to exclude, intimidate, or cause discomfort
is a violation of the Code of Conduct. In order to foster a positive
and professional learning environment we encourage the following kinds of
behaviors in all platforms and events:

- use welcoming and inclusive language
- everyone participates and no one dominates
- listen to understand
- share airtime
- one speaker at a time
- disagree with respect
- be respectful of different viewpoints and experiences
- all ideas are valid
- gracefully accept constructive criticism
- treat everything you hear as an opportunity to learn and grow
- seek common ground and understanding

## Collaboration

Students are expected to collaborate on work in this class, but all work turned
in must be completed by the individual receiving a grade. You should discuss
your ideas with classmates, discuss statistical questions with classmates, and
exchange completed problems for peer-review with classmates. You must not copy
solutions from classmates or others or use solutions that are not your own. If
you are unsure about the degree of collaboration that is acceptable, please ask
the professor for clarification. Cheating will not be tolerated. Academic
misconduct will result in a minimum penalty of a grade of F on the assignment.

## Plagiarism

Paraphrasing or quoting another’s work without citing the source is a form of
academic misconduct. This included the `R` code produced by someone else! 
Writing code is like writing a paper, it is obvious if you copied-and-pasted 
a sentence from someone else into your paper because the way each person writes 
is different. 

Even inadvertent or unintentional misuse or appropriation
of another's work (such as relying heavily on source material that is not
expressly acknowledged) is considered plagiarism. If you are struggling with 
writing the `R` code for an assignment, please reach out to me. I would prefer 
that I get to help you rather than you spending hours Googling things and 
get nowhere! 

If you have any questions about using and citing sources, you are expected to
ask for clarification. 

## Computer Assistance - Cal Poly Cares

If you are experiencing financial hardship and are unable to afford the
technology you need to be academically successful, you can apply to Cal Poly
Cares for assistance. <https://basicneeds.calpoly.edu/calpolycares> or email
financialaid@calpoly.edu to request information about how you can apply for 
funding to help cover the cost of purchasing a computer. 

## Illnesses 

In the event of illness, you should email me if you will miss class deadlines
due to illness as soon as practical. 

### COVID-19 Symptoms

COVID-19 affects different people in different ways, but we all need to do our 
part to prevent the spread of COVID-19. Taking these preventative
steps, as well as monitoring your health and staying home if you are feeling
unwell, will help protect the safety of the Cal Poly community and beyond:

- **Cover Your Face**: You are required to wear a mask or face coverings in most
public settings.  
- **Keep a Distance**: Avoid close contact and remain at least six feet away from others.  
- **Clean and Disinfect**: Wash your hands often and disinfect frequently touched surfaces.

## Americans with Disabilities Act

If you have a documented disability and would like to discuss academic
accommodations, please contact me before the third week of class.
