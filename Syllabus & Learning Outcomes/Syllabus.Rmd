Wednesdays | 2:00 pm - 3:00 pm
Thursdays  | 4:00 pm – 5:00 pm

Individual appointments or appointments can be made on Wednesdays from 1:00 - 
2:00. These appointments must be made _at least_ 24 hours in advance through
Calendly, using the following link: <https://calendly.com/allisontheobold> 

## Required Materials 

For this course we will be using one main textbook, accompanied by additional 
resources. All of the materials are free!

knitr::include_graphics('course images/open_intro.png')
```

## Required Technology 

- `R` is the statistical software we will be using in this course 
(<https://cran.r-project.org/>). 

- RStudio (<https://rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/>) is the most popular
way to interact with the `R` software. To function correctly, RStudio needs `R`
and therefore both need to be installed on your computer.

- If you are unable to install `R` and RStudio on your computer, you can use Cal
Poly's Virtual Computer Labs 
(<https://tech.calpoly.edu/virtual-computer-labs-appstream>). RStudio is
available in the "Computational" labs. You will need to use a two-factor log-in 
(Cal Poly + Duo Mobile), which will then take you to a list of applications. 
When you select RStudio, the page will load for 2-4 minutes 
(`r emo::ji("sad")`). Once you are in, you can work in RStudio the same way 
you would on your laptop, *except* everything you make during a session 
__cannot be accessed later__. 

- Canvas will be used for weekly course discussions and lab submissions
- Zoom will be used for weekly (synchronous) course meetings, office hours, and
small group collaborations

## Welcoming Classroom

I value diversity, social justice, inclusion and equity in this (and every)
class. I hold the fundamental belief that everyone is fully capable of engaging
in and mastering material. There is more than one way to address a statistical 
problem, and our learning will be richer by remaining open to different ideas,
by rejecting stereotypes, and being aware of--in order to minimize--our biases.
I look forward to getting to know you all as individuals and as a learning
community. 

## Course Description and Learning Objectives 

_Catalog Description_: Analysis of variance and regression analysis for students
not majoring in statistics or mathematics. Includes one-way classification,
randomized blocks, Latin squares, factorial designs, multiple regression,
diagnostics, and model comparison. 4 lectures. Prerequisite: Stat 217, Stat 218,
Stat 221 or Stat 312

_Expected Outcomes_:   

- Identify, describe, and contrast different study designs:
  * observational studies
  * one-factor completely randomized designs
  * randomized complete block designs

- Analyze and interpret the results of analysis of variance (ANOVA) from
different study designs, including multiple comparisons of means

- Analyze and interpret the results of simple linear regression models, and
multiple linear regression models which use both quantitative and categorical 
predictor variables 

<!-- * Lack of fit   -->
<!-- * Transformations   -->
<!-- * Indicator variables   -->
<!-- - Understand and know how to use variable selection techniques in regression. -->

- Describe the assumptions of the ANOVA and regression models and evaluate
whether they are violated for a particular analysis.

- Describe Type I error, Type II error, and statistical power in context; 
discuss how different aspects of a study design will affect errors and power

- Identify potential ethical issues surrounding data collection and analysis

- Create thoughtful univariate, bivariate, and multivariate data
visualizations to aid in the communication of statistical findings

- Carry out data wrangling tasks required to prepare data for analysis, 
including selecting variables, filtering observations, and mutating variables

- Understand the importance of reproducibility in scientific research, and 
collaborate in groups to create a reproducible statistical report

#### COVID-19 Addendum

I understand and appreciate the strange world we find ourselves living in today. 
Surrounded by a global pandemic, civil unrest, and an upcoming presidential 
election, many of us find ourselves overwhelmed, frustrated, confused, and sad. 
I appreciate all of these outside forces you are navigating, and will do my best 
to monitor the pace of our course so that no one feels left behind. Yes, this 
may mean that we may not hit every learning outcome. Instead, it is of utmost 
importance to me that you leave this course with an appreciation for
the complexities involved in building a statistical model, grasp of the
importance of good experimental design, and that you participate in group
conversations about statistical reasoning and problem solving. 

## Course Components 

Canvas will be your main resource for asynchronous course materials:

- class notes
- lecture videos
- discussion posts
- data sets
- lab assignments
- group projects
- software resources

Zoom will be the main resource for synchronous course participation:

- course meetings
- small group collaborations

### Communication 

Every Monday there will be an announcement on Canvas letting you know what is 
due over the next week, and the material we will be covering.

We will use discussion channels in Canvas to manage questions and
responses regarding course content. Please __do not__ send an email about
homework questions or questions about the course material. It will be very
helpful to others in the course to see the questions you have and the responses
to those questions. I will try to answer any questions posted to Canvas within
12 hours. If you think you can answer another student’s question, please
respond. I will correct any inaccurate responses. If you have a question about
something, the discussion channels are the first place you should go. Personal
matters may be sent via email.

Generally, I will work **either** Saturday or Sunday each weekend, and will work 
from approximately 8am to 5pm (PST) during the week. I will attempt to respond
to emails in 24 hours, but emails sent on a Saturday night may not be responded
to until Monday morning. If you don't hear back from me in 48 hours, assume I
did not receive your email and resend it!

### Weekly Schedule 

Each week in STAT 313 will, for the most part, look something like this:

```{r, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE, eval = FALSE}
grViz("digraph {
  
graph[layout = dot, rankdir = LR]

node [shape = rectangle, style = filled, fillcolor = LightBlue]
node[fontname = 'helvetica', width = 2, height = 1]

videos [label = 'Monday: \n Read chapter \n Watch lecture video', fillcolor = '#e40303']
post1 [label = 'Tuesday: \n Contribute concept \n discussion post', fillcolor = '#ff8c00']
in_person [label = 'Wednesday: \n Attend in-person lecture & activity \n Begin lab assignment', fillcolor = '#ffed00']
post2 [label = 'Thursday: \n Contribute think out loud discussion post \n Participate in group collaboration session', fillcolor = '#008026']
homework [label =  'Sunday: \n Submit lab assignment \n Wrap-up discussion conversations', fillcolor = '#004dff']

videos -> post1 -> in_person -> post2 -> homework
}")
```

```{r, out.width = '100%', fig.align = 'center'}
knitr::include_graphics('course images/weekly_flow.PNG')
```

### Readings and Videos

For this course, we'll be using a "flipped class" format. This means I will 
provide you with readings, pre-recorded videos, and guided tutorials for you to
watch, read, and do on your own time. You are expected to complete the readings,
watch the videos, and/or attempt the tutorials __before__ our weekly in-person
class meetings. 

### Course Meetings

The weekly course meetings will consist of group discussions and interactive lab
activities. You will be randomly spit into breakout rooms where you will work
with others to accomplish the activity. 

### Discussion Forums, Active Participation, & Tasks

You will be expected to regularly participate in online discussion forums on 
Canvas. Every two weeks you will be randomly assigned to a group of 3-4 
students, whom you will converse with when completing the week's required posts. 
You will be expected to complete the following discussion posts each week: 

1. "concept" post discussing and/or asking questions about the concepts
covered in the videos/reading

2. "thinking out loud" post describing your *rough-draft* thinking about a
designated problems

The "concept post" should be done as you are completing the reading and/or 
watching the video. The "thinking out loud" post should be done after the course
meeting, while you are working through the week's lab. You are expected 
to continue the conversation by responding to _at least_ two other student's
posts and addressing any comments made to your original thread. When responding 
to members of your group, respond first to those who have not yet received any
replies. Each post cannot have more than two responses until every post has 
has had a response. 

Scores for contributions to discussion forums will be based on the following
rubric:

Score | Justification  
------|-------------------------------------------------------------------
4	    | __Substantial Contributions__ -- Contributions to discussions that reflect thoughtfulness and move understanding of content forward. These contributions can include unique solution strategies, making connections across strategies, critical reflection, OR asking questions to promote discussion.  
3	    | __Supportive Contributions__ -- Contributions to discussions that reflect agreement or disagreement with others’ contributions without moving understanding of content forward OR offer summaries of others’ contributions without making connections.
0     | __No Contributions__ -- Does not contribute, includes statements such as “I agree” or “That’s interesting.” 
0     | __Negligence__ -- Contributions restrict or squelch the ability of others to contribute to the learning environment. 


### Work Sessions 

There will be 1 small group collaboration held __each week__ on Zoom, where
up to 4 students will work together on a task for the week. Each student
will sign up to attend __at least one__ small group collaboration during the
quarter. Each session will be held on Zoom, and recorded for all other students
to watch and reflect. Scores for this portion of the course will be allocated
based on attendance and by using the rubric for discussion forums (see above).

### Knowledge Checks

Each small group collaboration will be accompanied by a short knowledge check
for students to reflect on what they learned during the collaboration or through
watching the video.

### Homework/Labs

Labs will be assigned regularly based on content covered and in
preparation for upcoming activities. Problem sets will consist of explorations 
of concepts from the week's reading, and will often require `R` for completion. 

You are expected to submit your lab solutions electronically to Canvas as
__both__ an HTML and an RMarkdown document. Not every item will be scored;
however, feedback on representative items will be given for each assignment.

### Projects

There will be 2 projects throughout the quarter, where you will be asked to 
apply the statistical concepts you have learned in the context of real data. 
Each of these projects will be done in groups of 3-4. More details will be 
provided during class.

### (Oral) Exams

There will be 2 assessments designed for students to demonstrate their
understanding of content covered during the course. Each unit assessment will be
held virtually as an individual oral exam. These exams will require for you to 
talk through a set of open-response questions, demonstrating your understanding 
of the concepts. Each exam will follow the submission of the group projects, 
with the first occurring approximately halfway through the course and the second
taking place during finals week. 

## Course Assessment 

Your grade in STAT 313 will contain the following components.

```{r, echo = FALSE, warning = FALSE, message = FALSE, eval = TRUE}
grades <- tribble(
  ~category,  ~percent,
  "Discussion Forums, Active Participation, & Tasks", 25,
  "Homework", 10, 
  "Knowledge Checks", 10,
  "Live Small Group Collaborations (3)", 15,
  "Projects (2)", 20, 
  "Oral Assessments (2)", 20
  )

grades$location <- rep(1, 6)

grades %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = location, y = percent)) +
  geom_col(aes(fill = category), 
           col = 'black') + 
  guides(fill = FALSE) + 
  geom_text(aes(x = rep(1, 6),
                label = c('Discussions & Participation (25%)',
                          'Homework (10%)',
                          'Knowledge Checks (10%)',
                          'Small Group Collaborations (15%)', 
                          'Oral Assessments (20%)', 
                          'Projects (20%)'),
                y = c(87, 70, 60, 47, 30, 10))) +
  labs(x = '', y = 'Cumulative percent') + 
  theme(axis.text.x = element_blank()) +
  scale_fill_manual(values = pride_pal)

```

### Grading 

I expect that you will approach each homework assignment seriously, investing 
the necessary time and energy to prepare your responses. All items will be 
scored using the following four-point scale. 

Score   | Justification
--------|--------------
4       | __Excellent__ -- Outstanding work that exhibits comprehensive and thoughtful understanding of the content of the assignment. Errors do not occur in the assignment.
3       | __Good__ -- Work reflects a solid understanding of the content of the assignment. Work may not exhibit original perspectives. Several errors may occur in the assignment. 
R       | __Redo (Required)__ -- Work satisfies the requirements of the assignment while missing the spirit of the assignment. May be an incomplete rendering of the assignment. The work may contain inconsistencies or demonstrate limited understanding of the content. May be incoherent or poorly written. 
1       | __Poor__ -- The work shows a lack of understanding of the assignment.
0       | __No credit__ -- The problem was not seriously attempted. 

</br>

Each homework assignment will receive a score that reflects the average 
points-per-question. For example, suppose your homework assignment has four
questions and you receive the following scores on each problem: 3, 4, 3, and 4.
Then, your overall score is (3+4+3+4)/4 = 3.5. Suppose you received the
following scores (3, 4, 3, and R). Then, your initial overall score is
(3+4+3+0)/4 = 2.5 (Redo 1). Note: If you have a redo on an assignment, a total
score of 0 will be entered into the gradebook for that assignment until the redo
has been completed. 

Problems marked with an “R” __must__ be redone and returned
within __two days__ of receiving the assignment back. Late redos receive a zero
but still must be turned in to fulfill the spirit of redos. Work successfully
redone (on time) will receive a maximum grade of 3. When you submit your redo, 
label the revision with your name, the assignment number, and if applicable,
the page and problem number. It is possible to have a redo on a redo.

__Do not__ interpret 3/4 as equivalent to a grade of 75%. This rubric is
intended to be about the quality of your work, not the percentage of points
earned. It is likely that students consistently scoring “Good” on this rubric
will earn at least a B- in the course.

Letter grades will be assigned according to the following minimums: 3.75 (A),
3.0 (B-), 2.85 (C), below 2.85 (C-, D, or F).

If you have more than three “0” grades due to turning assignments in late,
un-revised “Rs,” class absences resulting in “0” participation grade, or missed
assignments, the highest grade you will earn for the class is a C-. 


## Late Work Policy 

Homework and redos are expected to be submitted on time. However, every student 
will be permitted to submit **one** assignment 24 hours late without question.
You do not need to contact me to use this allowance, but if you find 
yourself in a position where you have use this allowance and you cannot complete
the assignment by the due date, __you are expected to email me__. Once you email
me, we can work together to find a deadline that is fair to both you and other 
students. If I do not hear from you, I will take a 5% reduction in score for
every day an assignment is late, up to four days

You are also expected to participate in the week's discussions in a timely 
manner. You will not be able to see your group's posts until you have created a
post of your own. Thus, if you neglect to post anything until Friday, you will 
only have until Sunday night to create thoughtful responses to the other posts 
from your group. If you find that you are unable to participate in the week's 
discussion posts in a timely manner, __please contact me__. Once you contact 
me, we can create a timeline that will both allow for you to participate in the 
discussions and allow for members of your group to receive feedback from you. 


## Time Dedication Expectations

In a face-to-face lecture course like STAT 313, each unit of credit represents
one hour of in class instruction and approximately 2 hours of work outside of
class per week. This equals approximately 9 hours of student work for a 3-unit
class: 3 hours in-class and approximately 6 hours outside of class each week.

For a 3-unit asynchronous, I expect you to work approximately 1-3 hours per day
(Mon-Friday), plus another 3-6 hours over the weekend (Sat-Sun). I will attempt
to follow this guideline as I develop and post materials for the course, but
please reach out if the time you are spending on the materials for this course
falls far beyond these time guidelines! 

## Behavioral Expectations 

This course will use group work and classroom activities to better engage your
understanding of the material. The environment for these discussions and
activities is expected to adhere to ground rules, so that we create an open
space where everyone feels welcome and supported, and comfortable with voicing 
their opinion. 

By participating in this community, students accept to abide by the classroom 
Code of Conduct and accept the procedures by which any Code of Conduct incidents
are resolved. Any form of behavior to exclude, intimidate, or cause discomfort
is a violation of the Code of Conduct. In order to foster a positive
and professional learning environment we encourage the following kinds of
behaviors in all platforms and events:

- use welcoming and inclusive language
- everyone participates and no one dominates
- listen to understand
- share airtime
- one speaker at a time
- disagree with respect
- be respectful of different viewpoints and experiences
- all ideas are valid
- gracefully accept constructive criticism
- treat everything you hear as an opportunity to learn and grow
- seek common ground and understanding

## Collaboration

Students are expected to collaborate on work in this class, but all work turned
in must be completed by the individual receiving a grade. You should discuss
your ideas with classmates, discuss statistical questions with classmates, and
exchange completed problems for peer-review with classmates. You must not copy
solutions from classmates or others or use solutions that are not your own. If
you are unsure about the degree of collaboration that is acceptable, please ask
the professor for clarification. Cheating will not be tolerated. Academic
misconduct will result in a minimum penalty of a grade of F on the assignment.

## Computer Assistance - Cal Poly Cares

If you are experiencing financial hardship and are unable to afford the
technology you need to be academically successful, you can apply to Cal Poly
Cares for assistance. Https://basicneeds.calpoly.edu/calpolycares or email
financialaid@calpoly.edu to request information about how you can apply for 
funding to help cover the cost of purchasing a computer. 

## Plagiarism

Paraphrasing or quoting another’s work without citing the source is a form of
academic misconduct. Even inadvertent or unintentional misuse or appropriation
of another's work (such as relying heavily on source material that is not
expressly acknowledged) is considered plagiarism. If you have any questions
about using and citing sources, you are expected to ask for clarification. 

## Illnesses 

In the event of illness, you should email me if you will miss class deadlines
due to illness as soon as practical. 

### COVID-19 Symptoms

COVID-19 affects different people in different ways, but we all need to do our 
part to prevent the spread of COVID-19. Taking these preventative
steps, as well as monitoring your health and staying home if you are feeling
unwell, will help protect the safety of the Cal Poly community and beyond:

- **Cover Your Face**: You are required to wear a mask or face coverings in most
public settings.  
- **Keep a Distance**: Avoid close contact and remain at least six feet away from others.  
- **Clean and Disinfect**: Wash your hands often and disinfect frequently touched surfaces.

## Americans with Disabilities Act

If you have a documented disability and would like to discuss academic
accommodations, please contact me before the third week of class.
