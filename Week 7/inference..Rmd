Most of the inferential procedures covered in this text are grounded in quantifying how one data set would differ from another when they are both taken from the same population. It doesnâ€™t make sense to take repeated samples from the same population because if you have the means to take more samples, a larger sample size will benefit you more than the exact same sample twice. Instead, we measure how the samples behave under an estimate of the population.

```{r 95PercentConfidenceInterval, fig.cap="Twenty-five samples of size $n=300$ were simulated when $p = 0.30$. For each sample, a confidence interval was created to try to capture the true proportion $p$. However, 1 of these 25 intervals did not capture $p = 0.30$.", warning=FALSE, fig.width=10}

set.seed(4747)
num.sim <- 25
n       <- 300
p       <- 0.3
p.hat   <- rbinom(num.sim, n, p) / n
SE      <- sqrt(p.hat * (1 - p.hat) / n)


par(mar=c(2, 1, 1, 1), mgp=c(2.7, 0.9, 0))
xR <- p + 4*c(-1, 1)*max(SE)
yR <- c(0, 25)
plot(xR, yR, type='n', xlab='',
     ylab='', axes=FALSE)
abline(v=p, lty=2, col=COL[6])
axis(1, at=p + c(-0.05, 0, 0.05),
     c("0.25", "p = 0.30", "0.35"), cex.axis=1.15)
for(i in 1:num.sim){
	ci <- p.hat[i] + 2 * c(-1, 1) * SE[i]
	if(abs(p.hat[i] - p) > 2 * SE[i]){
		col <- COL[4]
		points(p.hat[i], i, cex=1.4, col=col)
	} else {
		col <- COL[1]
	}
	points(p.hat[i], i, pch=20, cex=1.2, col=col)
	lines(ci, rep(i, 2), col=col)
}
