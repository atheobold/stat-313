As you become more familiar working with data in R, operations like creating a
new variable or changing an existing variable will soon become second nature.
However, this is not how many other people work with data. For example, in the
activity to create a new variable (named hsb2) the author chose to write the
following code:

``hsb2 <- hsb2 %>%
mutate(read_cat = if_else(read < avg_read,
                          "below average",
                          "at or above average")
       )
``


However, another researcher could have chosen to create this variable by
directly inputting it into the Excel spreadsheet (e.g. opening the Excel file,
and hand entering the value of read_cat).




If both approaches end up with the same result, what is the benefit of using R
to work with your data?
