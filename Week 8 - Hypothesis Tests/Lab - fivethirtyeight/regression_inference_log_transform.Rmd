Great for log transformation homework!!! 

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)

library(tidyverse) ## for data wrangling & visualization
library(moderndive) ## for regression table
library(infer) ## for simulation based methods

library(fivethirtyeight) ## for data -- you need to install first! 
```

# Data 

```{r}
bechdel %>% 
  glimpse()

bechdel %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = log(budget), y = log(domgross_2013))) + 
  geom_point()

```
