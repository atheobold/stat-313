# Write-Up Guidelines

You will be summarizing your results in a (guided) written report following the
__Project Writing Guidelines__ posted on Canvas. The results __must__ be 
written in the RMarkdown template provided. You can include all pertinent plots
inline in the typed document, rather than in the appendix. Your group will be 
submitting both the RMarkdown file used to generate your report and the knitted 
HTML file to Canvas by __Sunday, October 25 at 11:59pm__. 

Begin by downloading the RMarkdown and data files from Canvas and saving them on
your computer in the __same__ folder. Then open the RMarkdown file in RStudio 
and run the first chunk of code reading the data in. If you encounter an error, 
make sure that the data are located in the same folder as the RMarkdown file! 

# Data Background 

The National Center for Education Statistics (NCES) administers the Integrated
Postsecondary Education Data System (IPEDS) [(web link)](https://nces.ed.gov/ipeds/),
which is a large-scale survey that
collects institution-level data from postsecondary institutions in the United
States (50 states and the District of Columbia) and other U.S. jurisdictions.
IPEDS defines a postsecondary institution as an organization that is open to the
public and has the provision of postsecondary education or training beyond the
high school level as one of its primary missions. 

Currently, there are 12 survey components that comprise the annual IPEDS data
collection cycle. The 12 survey components are separated into one of three
seasonal reporting periodsâ€“fall, winter, or spring. We will be considering data 
from the 2018 - 2019 fall and spring collection periods, namely data on
Institutional Completions and Student Financial Aid. In the data from the 
surveys, each university is given a unique identifying code. For example, Cal
Poly is 110422. For more information about the IPEDS survey, see
<https://nces.ed.gov/ipeds/ReportYourData/IpedsSurveyMethodology>. 

As is typical in educational data, students are not randomly assigned to receive 
financial aid, but instead receive grants based on merit and need. As
universities focus more on improving the diversity of their graduates, they will 
be looking into what may be driving factors of students' success.

For this project, we will consider the following data for the universities
surveyed by IPEDS: 

- the percentage of graduates who identify as Black
- the degree of the graduates (Associates, Bachelors, Masters)
- the percentage of undergraduate students who receive federal, state, local, or
 institutional grants or support

Specifically, we will explore the relationship between the percentage of
graduates who identify as Black and the percentage of undergraduates who receive
some form of grant support. Additionally, we will investigate if and how this
relationship differs across degrees.

# Introduction (5 pts)

- (2 pts) Give a brief background of the research problem and how the data were
collected.

- (3 pts) Clearly outline the question(s) of interest you will address with the
statistical analysis. The more specific you define the question of interest
here, the easier the rest of the analysis and report will be. The research
questions should start with, "What is the relationship between..." and should be
as specific as possible. Your _Summary of Statistical Findings_ should directly
answer the question(s) you pose here.


# Statistical Methods (15 pts)

This section should lay out the steps, decisions, and logic leading to the
statistical model you will use to answer the research question of interest.

- (3 pt) Describe the response and explanatory variables.

- (3 pts) Produce data visualizations exploring the relationship(s) you are 
interested in investigating. Describe what you see in the visualizations, making
direct references to the plots! 

**Note:** Keep in mind that there are 1654 observations in the dataset, so you 
may want to use tools that help to alleviate overplotting! 

- (5 pts) Describe the appropriate statistical method you will use to answer
the question(s) of interest that you stated previously. Be specific about why the 
method being used are appropriate for the investigation at hand (e.g. types of 
variables). 

- (4 pts) Check all model conditions of the statistical method you used. 
Describe what each condition is __in the context of these data__. Reference and
include appropriate plots necessary for checking the model conditions. What
are your conclusions regarding the conditions? Justify your conclusions! 

# Summary of Statistical Findings (10 pts)

In this section you will write up your findings for each research question of
interest.

- (5 pts) What is your conclusion for the questions of interest? Namely, 
"What is the relationship between the percentage of graduates who identify as
Black and the percentage of undergraduates who receive some form of grant
support?" and "How does the relationship differ by degree awarded?". Base your
conclusion on the visualizations you created and the regression model you found.
Tailor your conclusion to communicate your results to a university administrator. 

- (5 pts) Interpret __in the context of the data__ each of the coefficient
estimates you got from R.

# Scope of Inference (4 pts)

Write a brief Scope of Inference statement. Specifically, answer these two
questions and comment on their implications:

- (2 pts) Were the observations randomly selected from some larger population? Based on 
the sampling method used, what larger population can you infer the results to? 

- (2 pts) Was the explanatory variable randomly assigned to observations? Based on the 
study design, are cause-and-effect statements justified?

Make sure you write the scope of inference specific to the language of the
data (not just generic statements)!

# Project Presentation (3 pts) 

- (1 pts) Your report should not have any spelling errors! To check for spelling 
errors in RStudio, click the green check mark button next to the "Knit" button. 

- (2 pts) Your report should look as neat and professional as possible. Make 
sure that your figures don't end up in the middle of your paragraphs, and that 
your sections have headings. If you would like to fine tune the appearance of
your report, please post questions to Canvas and I will respond ASAP. 

**Note:** Please try to make the output from the statistical model look as nice 
as possible. Output from `summary()` looks terrible in a statistical report! 
Try using the `get_regression_table()` function from the **moderndive** package
or the `tidy()` function from the **broom** package. 

# Group Evaluation (3 pts)

Each member of your group will fill out a group evaluation form detailing each 
member's contributions, cooperation, communication, and participation.
