## Precision & Accuracy 

```{r,fig.align='center', out.width= "60%", echo = FALSE}

In general:

- If the sampling of a sample of size $n$ is done at random, then
- the sample is unbiased and representative of the population of size $N$, thus
- any result based on the sample can generalize to the population, thus
- the point estimate is a “good guess” of the unknown population parameter, thus
- instead of performing a census, we can infer about the population using sampling.
