> Independence is about **observations** and relationships between observations. 

## Independence Within Groups

- What are the groups in your analysis?
- Are the observations *within* those groups related?
  * Is an observation included multiple times within a group?
  * Are there relationships (e.g., biological, spatial, temporal) between the observations?
  
## Independence Between Groups

- What are the groups in your analysis?
- Are the observations *between* those groups related?
  * Can an observation appear in more than one group?
