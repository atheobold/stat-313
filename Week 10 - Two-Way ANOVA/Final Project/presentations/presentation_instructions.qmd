During finals week each of you will give a 3-minute presentation on **one** aspect of your final project you found the most interesting. Notice, you need to pick one aspect, since your presentation is so short. 

Here are some examples of what you could choose:

- The relationships you saw in the visualizations
- The design of the study
- The final model you selected

Of course you could choose other topics, the only requirement is that your topic is related to what you did in your final project. 

## Slides

For your presentation you are allowed to make **two** slides:

1. A title slide (make it fun!) with your name
2. A content slide

**You slides are due on Tuesday by 5pm.**

::: {.callout-caution}
Your slides must be submitted as a PDF. Make sure they are saved in the correct orientation!

## Presentations

For ease, I will randomly order the presentations. If you have a strong preference for when you would like to present, you can request a position. However, I cannot guarantee that I can accommodate every request. 

**I will publish the order of presentations by Wednesday at 5pm.**
