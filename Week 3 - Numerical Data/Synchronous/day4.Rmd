.huge[The Problem]

.large[It’s incredibly rare for scientists, including statisticians, to explicitly
think about that conditions underlying their models.] 

<!-- Beyond “checking” higher level assumptions in a stale and automatic fashion.  -->

<!-- I had many conversations in very different contexts with scientists about what -->
<!-- the average calculated from the data (or mean in a model) could reasonably -->
<!-- represent and whether that was really what the scientist was after.  -->

.larger[Why so much resistance?]

</br> 
</br> 

- Departments hold specific expectations of statistics courses. 

- These expectations are conditional on the assumption that means represent 
**the** magic quantity of interest 


- I'm then expected to educate you to "play the game" in the scientific 
culture of averages

Methods based on averages are available, easy, convenient, and take little
creativity — and they are expected in our scientific culture. 

Justification for using averages is simply not demanded — though justification
for use of anything but averages is incredibly difficult to sell.
