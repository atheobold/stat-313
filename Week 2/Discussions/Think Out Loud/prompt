A student is working through the Introduction to R & RStudio lab, and they are
having a difficult time with exercise 3. They feel that their code is correct
and they should be getting a plot, but they keep getting an error from R that
says: 

Error in FUN(X[[i]], ...) : object 'boy_ratio' not found

Below is the code the student used when trying to create their plot. What advise
would you give to them?


arbuthnot %>%
  mutate(boy_ratio = boys / total)

 

arbuthnot %>%  ggplot(aes(x=year, y=boy_ratio)) +geom_point()
