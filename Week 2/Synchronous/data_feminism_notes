Data Feminism Notes


- Examine Power

Look at your work through the lens of power inequalities and ask yourself:

“Why is the data science being done? For whose interests and goal?”

- Challenge Power

Create work that highlights issues for groups that hold less power in society
and critique the power structures as they currently stand.

“Am I reinforcing existing power dynamics? Does my work empower under
represented groups?”


- Rethink binaries and hierarchies

Current structures of society and the inherent fact that binaries are often
used in data collection means that many groups are not visible in data because
they are not counted.

“Who is missing from these data and why?”

- Elevate emotion and embodiment 

Acknowledge that humans are behind datasets and that creations based on that
data will impact those humans in unequal ways.

Emotive representations of those human filled datasets help to acknowledge that
data is more than just numbers.


- Embrace pluralism 

Center the perspectives of those whom the data is about, those that are local,
and those whose opinions society does not already elevate.

“Whose input is going into the decisions of how the data is being used and
displayed?”


- Consider context

Data itself is collected by humans under certain conditions and thus is not
neutral or objective.

“Does my work adequately communicate the context in which the data was collected
and is being presented?”

- Make labor visible
